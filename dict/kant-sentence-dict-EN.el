     "That element in a sensuous object which is not itself sensuous, I may be allowed to term intelligible."
     "The first is the physico-theological argument, the second the cosmological, the third the ontological."
     "The former always require deduction, which in the case of the latter may be altogether dispensed with."
     "The former is properly a consequence of the principle of causality — one of the analogies of experience."
     "The former is the synthesis of a manifold, the parts of which do not necessarily belong to each other."
     "This transcendental principle of the mathematics of phenomena greatly enlarges our à priori cognition."
     "Transcendental antithetic is an investigation into the antinomy of pure reason, its causes and result."
     "We shall find that it opens up to us an entirely new view of the conflict in which reason is involved."
     "But do we thus extend the limits of our knowledge beyond the field of possible experience? By no means."
     "But the already practised reader will do this for himself, or discover the clue to such an arrangement."
     "But the phenomena, corresponding to it, are not given as things in themselves, but in experience alone."
     "For such an object can never be presented to us, because it cannot be given by any possible experience."
     "Here it must be specially remembered that we must consider the order of time and not the lapse thereof."
     "In the dialectic of reason there is no victory gained which need in the least disturb your tranquility."
     "It follows that something that is absolutely necessary must exist, if change exists as its consequence."
     "It follows that this necessary existence must be regarded as the highest member of the cosmical series."
     "It was a design worthy of an acute thinker like Aristotle, to search for these fundamental conceptions."
     "Let it be supposed, that there is no other kind of causality than that according to the laws of nature."
     "Nature, therefore, and transcendental freedom are distinguishable as conformity to law and lawlessness."
     "Our apprehension of the manifold in a phenomenon is always successive, is Consequently always changing."
     "Our endeavour to reach, not the unconditioned causality, but the unconditioned existence, of substance."
     "Reason never has an immediate relation to an object; it relates immediately to the understanding alone."
     "That is to say, a certain degree of change does not originate from the addition of many simple changes."
     "The first is active — the cause being regarded as beginning a series of conditions as its effect (infit)."
     "This law must, consequently, be based upon pure transcendental, and not upon empirical, considerations."
     "Every conception, every title, under which many cognitions rank together, may be called a logical place."
     "For this reason we ought to call these conceptions, conceptions of comparison (conceptus comparationis)."
     "Consequently it is a synthesis of that which though heterogeneous, is represented as connected à priori."
     "Grant that either the world itself is necessary, or that there is contained in it a necessary existence."
     "I can only maintain, that is, affirm as necessarily valid for every one, that which produces conviction."
     "In the pure sense of the categories, that is contingent the contradictory opposite of which is possible."
     "Intuition must therefore here lend its aid, by means of which, and thus only, our synthesis is possible."
     "It is not even sufficient to instruct us as to the possibility of a being which we do not know to exist."
     "Of time we cannot have any external intuition, any more than we can have an internal intuition of space."
     "The logical exposition of thought in general is mistaken for a metaphysical determination of the object."
     "There is, consequently, an infinite series of degrees of consciousness down to its entire disappearance."
     "This can only be effected, however, by a thorough training in the critical investigation of pure reason."
     "We may illustrate the systematic unity produced by the three logical principles in the following manner."
     "And thus it satisfies, in one respect at least, the requirements of the conception of absolute necessity."
     "But in internal intuition there is nothing permanent, for the Ego is but the consciousness of my thought."
     "Consequently, it cannot be cogitated as separated from the world of sense — the sum total of all phenomena."
     "For, if I ask whether the soul is not really of a spiritual nature — it is a question which has no meaning."
     "I shall now proceed to exhibit the several momenta of this solution, and to consider them in their order."
     "In former cases, the result was that both contradictory dialectical statements were declared to be false."
     "It does not begin from conceptions, but from common experience, and requires a basis in actual existence."
     "It is not our business to inquire here into the utility of this principle in the investigation of nature."
     "That sort of intuition which relates to an object by means of sensation is called an empirical intuition."
     "The latter is that in our cognition which is called cognition à posteriori, that is, empirical intuition."
     "The same is the case with the double answer to the question regarding the extent, in space, of the world."
     "The world has no beginning, and no limits in space, but is, in relation both to time and space, infinite."
     "These ideas require absolute totality in the series, and thus place reason in inextricable embarrassment."
     "We have, therefore, nothing but nature to which we must look for connection and order in cosmical events."
     "A principle which removes these limits, nay, which authorizes us to overstep them, is called transcendent."
     "But this would require very different grounds of proof from those presented by the analogy with human art."
     "Hence this will, which is the condition of the application of this unity in concreto, must be so likewise."
     "Consequently, the world, as regards space, is not limited, that is, it is infinite in regard to extension."
     "Hence, pure reason is the faculty which contains the principles of cognizing anything absolutely à priori."
     "I venture, further, to hope, that this system will maintain the same unalterable character for the future."
     "In a mathematical definition the conception is formed, in a philosophical definition it is only explained."
     "In the second place, we shall limit our investigations to those principles which relate to the categories."
     "On the other hand, morality alone, and with it, mere desert, is likewise far from being the complete good."
     "Space is no discursive, or as we say, general conception of the relations of things, but a pure intuition."
     "That in the phenomenon which contains the condition of this necessary rule of apprehension, is the object."
     "The determinations of a substance, which are only particular modes of its existence, are called accidents."
     "The possibility of experience is, then, that which gives objective reality to all our à priori cognitions."
     "The practical forms a clue to the answer of the theoretical, and — in its highest form — speculative question."
     "The third question: If I act as I ought to do, what may I then hope? — is at once practical and theoretical."
     "This side has also the advantage of popularity; and this constitutes no small part of its claim to favour."
     "Thus all human cognition begins with intuitions, proceeds from thence to conceptions, and ends with ideas."
     "But I cannot thus attain to the cognition of a systematic unity of all the phenomena of the internal sense."
     "But no ens realissimum is in any respect different from another, and what is valid of some is valid of all."
     "And now we shall proceed to point out the extensive utility and influence of this postulate of possibility."
     "But few possess the ability, and still fewer the inclination, to take a comprehensive view of a new system."
     "But this rule, precisely because it is a rule, requires for itself direction from the faculty of judgement."
     "But we are met at the very commencement with an ambiguity, which may easily occasion great misapprehension."
     "General logic contains no directions or precepts for the faculty of judgement, nor can it contain any such."
     "If we propose to ourselves any end whatever, the conditions of its attainment are hypothetically necessary."
     "It is only the cognition of the object of thought, the determining of the object, which requires intuition."
     "Let us suppose that nothing precedes an event, upon which this event must follow in conformity with a rule."
     "There are, accordingly, only four cosmological ideas, corresponding with the four titles of the categories."
     "They are the two pure forms of all intuitions, and thereby make synthetical propositions à priori possible."
     "Upon this perfectly natural — but not on that account reliable — inference does the cosmological argument rest."
     "But we feel persuaded that we are able to proceed beyond a conception, and to extend our cognition à priori."
     "His belief is, even in his own judgement, only contingent: another man might, perhaps come nearer the truth."
     "For accidental observations, made according to no preconceived plan, cannot be united under a necessary law."
     "The conception of a noumenon is therefore merely a limitative conception and therefore only of negative use."
     "The proposition is that the object of the internal sense, the thinking Ego, is an absolute simple substance."
     "The subsumption of the condition of another possible judgement under the condition of the rule is the minor."
     "The whole interest of reason, speculative as well as practical, is centred in the three following questions:"
     "This complete quantity of the extent in relation to such a condition is called universality (universalitas)."
     "This synthesis is pure when the diversity is not given empirically but à priori (as that in space and time)."
     "Time is not a discursive, or as it is called, general conception, but a pure form of the sensuous intuition."
     "We see things around us change, arise, and pass away; they, or their condition, must therefore have a cause."
     "But we can form no system of happiness, except in so far as it is dispensed in strict proportion to morality."
     "But, in itself, scepticism does not give us any certain information in regard to the bounds of our knowledge."
     "For the existence of an aggregate cannot be necessary, if no single part of it possesses necessary existence."
     "For there is only one time in which all different times must be placed, not as coexistent, but as successive."
     "For, in relation to a given conditioned, conditions are presupposed and considered to be given along with it."
     "I am quite well satisfied with the latter part of this opinion of the philosophers of the Leibnitzian school."
     "Accordingly, the objects of sense were compared by Leibnitz as things in general merely in the understanding."
     "Deceived by such a proof of the power of reason, we can perceive no limits to the extension of our knowledge."
     "It is framed in the following manner: If something exists, an absolutely necessary being must likewise exist."
     "Neither can we assert that reason has previously inferred this unity from the contingent nature of phenomena."
     "Now all our intuitions are sensuous, and our cognition, in so far as the object of it is given, is empirical."
     "Operative nature is therefore too large for every conception we can form in the synthesis of cosmical events."
     "Reason allows itself to be satisfied upon insufficient grounds, with regard to the completion of this series."
     "Such is the proposition of the schoolman that Alexander could not have subdued any countries without an army."
     "The /analysis/ of the metaphysician separates pure cognition /à priori/ into two heterogeneous elements, viz."
     "The former alone proves nothing as to the connection of the manifold in an object, for it is quite arbitrary."
     "The so-called proof of the simple nature of the soul from the unity of apperception, is a very plausible one."
     "These dialectical propositions are so many attempts to solve four natural and unavoidable problems of reason."
     "This is the great utility of the sceptical mode of treating the questions addressed by pure reason to itself."
     "This principle is that, of every two contradictorily opposed predicates, only one can belong to a conception."
     "To know what questions we may reasonably propose is in itself a strong evidence of sagacity and intelligence."
     "We have shown that no transcendental use can be made either of the conceptions of reason or of understanding."
     "We remark this empirical character in his actions, which reveal the presence of certain powers and faculties."
     "We should therefore meet not only with a relation of things in space, but also a relation of things to space."
     "And yet the hope of better fortune never deserts those who are accustomed to the dogmatical mode of procedure."
     "And yet this wise arrangement has been unthinkingly explained from the equilibrium of the formerly fluid mass."
     "Apperception is something real, and the simplicity of its nature is given in the very fact of its possibility."
     "Empirical intuition is therefore not a composition of phenomena and space (of perception and empty intuition)."
     "For the ideal, of which we are at present speaking, is based, not upon an arbitrary, but upon a natural, idea."
     "Both of the above arguments are transcendental; in other words, they do not proceed upon empirical principles."
     "But I do not think that those which rest upon a secure foundation, such as mathematics, physical science, etc."
     "Consequently, the manifold in a given intuition is necessarily subject to the categories of the understanding."
     "I divide all apodeictic propositions, whether demonstrable or immediately certain, into dogmata and mathemata."
     "In the former case, the relation between them is only empirical, and an à priori representation is impossible."
     "It would be my own fault, if out of that which I should reckon as phenomenon, I made mere illusory appearance."
     "Perception is empirical consciousness, that is to say, a consciousness which contains an element of sensation."
     "Space then is a necessary representation à priori, which serves for the foundation of all external intuitions."
     "Space, as the pure form of external intuition, is limited as a condition à priori to external phenomena alone."
     "Subjective sufficiency is termed conviction (for myself); objective sufficiency is termed certainty (for all)."
     "The desired proof must therefore demonstrate that we have experience of external things, and not mere fancies."
     "The questions which naturally arise in the consideration of this dialectic of pure reason, are therefore: 1st."
     "The same would be the case with the other kinds of cognition, if their principles were but firmly established."
     "The science of natural philosophy (physics) contains in itself synthetical judgements à priori, as principles."
     "There is no such thing as freedom, but everything in the world happens solely according to the laws of nature."
     "This analogon is the idea of the maximum of the division and the connection of our cognition in one principle."
     "This leads us to inquire why it is that, in metaphysics, the sure path of science has not hitherto been found."
     "Time, therefore, is not to be regarded as an object, but as the mode of representation of myself as an object."
     "But I must avoid prolixity, and leave the task of illustrating this by examples to the reader’s own reflection."
     "For it is one part of the duty of transcendental philosophy to establish the possibility of mathematics itself."
     "For the possibility of the conditioned presupposes the totality of its conditions, but not of its consequences."
     "He observes the symptoms, and concludes, according to the best of his judgement, that it is a case of phthisis."
     "If, on the other hand, it has its ground in the particular character of the subject, it is termed a persuasion."
     "But, though all our knowledge begins with experience, it by no means follows that all arises out of experience."
     "For there is no other function or faculty existing in the understanding besides those enumerated in that table."
     "In the above proposition, then, lies the beginning of a deduction of the pure conceptions of the understanding."
     "In the assertorical, we regard the proposition as real (true); in the apodeictical, we look on it as necessary."
     "It consists, therefore, in the succession of the manifold, in so far as that succession is subjected to a rule."
     "Now a negation cannot be cogitated as determined, without cogitating at the same time the opposite affirmation."
     "On the side of Dogmatism, or of the thesis, therefore, in the determination of the cosmological ideas, we find:"
     "The aims set before us are not arbitrarily proposed, but are imposed upon us by the nature of cognition itself."
     "The question now is as to a criterion, by which we may securely distinguish a pure from an empirical cognition."
     "Thus it is evident that a particular act of the understanding is here necessary; and so in the other instances."
     "To avoid ambiguity, it seems advisable in many cases to employ this term instead of that mentioned in the text."
     "And thus I should deny the existence of an infinite, without, however affirming the existence of a finite world."
     "But this fallacy is not a consciously devised one, but a perfectly natural illusion of the common reason of man."
     "If we keep to this hypothesis, as a principle which is purely regulative, even error cannot be very detrimental."
     "Accordingly, as this cannot change in existence, its quantity in nature can neither be increased nor diminished."
     "Afterwards be believed that he had discovered five others, which were added under the name of post predicaments."
     "But the most important point is this, that to a something of this kind not one category can be found applicable."
     "For they have, in truth, no relation to any object, in experience, for the very reason that they are only ideas."
     "For, in the contrary case, it would be limited by a void time on the one hand, and by a void space on the other."
     "In the idea, pure reason possesses even causality and the power of producing that which its conception contains."
     "It follows that idealism — at least problematical idealism, is perfectly unavoidable in this rationalistic system."
     "These are set forth in the proposition, so renowned among the schoolmen — ‘/Quodlibet ens est UNUM, VERUM, BONUM/."
     "This discovery of our deficiencies must produce a great change in the determination of the aims of human reason."
     "This predicate is only applicable to things in so far as they appear to us, that is, are objects of sensibility."
     "We cannot employ an à priori conception with certainty, until we have made a transcendental deduction therefore."
     "Where this process, conducted as it is mechanically, so to speak, will end, cannot be determined with certainty."
     "As regard the manner in which I pass beyond my conception by the aid of experience, no doubts can be entertained."
     "For example, the apprehension of the manifold in the phenomenon of a house which stands before me, is successive."
     "For it is of course only in phenomena that we can empirically cognize this continuity in the connection of times."
     "For nature is properly the only object presented to us, in regard to which reason requires regulative principles."
     "Hence in a perpetual circle, inasmuch as we must always employ it, in order to frame any judgement respecting it."
     "If the whole is given empirically, it is possible to recede in the series of its internal conditions to infinity."
     "But it is only from the practical point of view that a theoretically insufficient judgement can be termed belief."
     "But this proposition does not signify that I, as an object, am, for myself, a self-subsistent being or substance."
     "Either the object alone makes the representation possible, or the representation alone makes the object possible."
     "It animates the study of nature, as it itself derives its existence and draws ever new strength from that source."
     "It is in all acts of consciousness one and the same, and unaccompanied by it, no representation can exist for me."
     "Nevertheless, space is so conceived of, for all parts of space are equally capable of being produced to infinity."
     "Opposed to this is empirical knowledge, or that which is possible only à posteriori, that is, through experience."
     "That is to say, not the conditions of pure reason, but only their effects in the internal sense, precede the act."
     "The actions of natural causes are, accordingly, themselves effects, and presuppose causes preceding them in time."
     "The former is purely /à priori/, the latter is partially so, but is also dependent on other sources of cognition."
     "The logical paralogism consists in the falsity of an argument in respect of its form, be the content what it may."
     "This, again, is only possible, to man at least, on condition that the object affect the mind in a certain manner."
     "We may find out that the will is free, but this knowledge only relates to the intelligible cause of our volition."
     "But we proceed to the conjecture that comets describe a parabola, a figure which is closely allied to the ellipse."
     "For that which stands in connection with a perception according to the laws of the progress of experience is real."
     "For the object must be given in experience, and the question relates to the adequateness of the object to an idea."
     "For we are not speaking here of an absolutely first beginning in relation to time, but as regards causality alone."
     "A distinction is commonly made between that which is immediately cognized and that which is inferred or concluded."
     "Besides, the proposition that different times cannot be coexistent could not be derived from a general conception."
     "But conceptions, as predicates of possible judgements, relate to some representation of a yet undetermined object."
     "In our theory of the true nature of these two original forms of the sensibility, both difficulties are surmounted."
     "In the elaboration of our experience, they may also be employed with great advantage, as heuristic principles."
     "In truth, it is not images of objects, but schemata, which lie at the foundation of our pure sensuous conceptions."
     "It is extremely advantageous to be able to bring a number of investigations under the formula of a single problem."
     "Now every change has a cause, which evidences its causality in the whole time during which the charge takes place."
     "Now that alone determines the position of another thing in time which is the cause of it or of its determinations."
     "On the contrary, it is left completely undetermined what the nature or properties of this so-called ground may be."
     "Such hypothetical defences against the pretensions of an opponent must not be regarded as declarations of opinion."
     "That which is possible only under conditions which are themselves merely possible, is not possible in any respect."
     "The difference between a confused and a clear representation is merely logical and has nothing to do with content."
     "The problem was merely this — whether freedom and natural necessity can exist without opposition in the same action."
     "There lurks in the procedure of rational Psychology a paralogism, which is represented in the following syllogism:"
     "They always felt the need of going beyond mere nature, for the purpose of making a first beginning comprehensible."
     "This series in past time is represented as real, not in itself, but only in connection with a possible experience."
     "Thus general logic, in its analytical department, is a formal canon for the faculties of understanding and reason."
     "But this does not authorize the rational psychologist to affirm, from mere conceptions, its permanence beyond life."
     "Have no anxiety for the practical interests of humanity — these are never imperilled in a purely speculative dispute."
     "All our knowledge relates, finally, to possible intuitions, for it is these alone that present objects to the mind."
     "Beyond these limits they represent to us nothing, for they belong only to sense, and have no reality apart from it."
     "It is merely a principle for the enlargement and extension of experience as far as is possible for human faculties."
     "It possesses, you say, all reality, and you feel yourselves justified in admitting the possibility of such a being."
     "Such a system of pure speculative reason I hope to be able to publish under the title of /Metaphysic of Nature/."
     "The actual judgement, which enounces the assertion of the rule in the subsumed case, is the conclusion (conclusio)."
     "The construction of a conception is the presentation à priori of the intuition which corresponds to the conception."
     "The division of the parts of the whole (subdivisio or decompositio) is a regress in the series of these conditions."
     "This significance they derive from sensibility, which at the same time realizes the understanding and restricts it."
     "Thus metaphysics, according to the proper aim of the science, consists merely of synthetical propositions à priori."
     "We know no other properties that make up the conception of substance phenomenal in space, and which we term matter."
     "Consequently, in cognition, their application to objects of experience is the only legitimate use of the categories."
     "For in the conception of matter, I do not cogitate its permanency, but merely its presence in space, which it fills."
     "In the former case, the understanding cogitates more under its conceptions, in the latter it cogitates more in them."
     "Mathematics fulfils this requirement by the construction of the figure, which is a phenomenon evident to the senses."
     "Now the infinity of a series consists in the fact that it never can be completed by means of a successive synthesis."
     "On the other hand, let us compare a singular with a general judgement, merely as a cognition, in regard to quantity."
     "Problematical judgements are those in which the affirmation or negation is accepted as merely possible (ad libitum)."
     "Reason goes its way in the empirical world, and follows, too, its peculiar path in the sphere of the transcendental."
     "The former of these classes of categories I would entitle the mathematical, and the latter the dynamical categories."
     "The full discussion of this subject will be found in its proper place in the chapter on the antinomy of pure reason."
     "The minor contains an experience, the major reasons from a general experience to the existence of a necessary being."
     "The procedure is in this case very similar to that which has been discussed in our remarks on the theological ideal."
     "The psychological idea is, therefore, meaningless and inapplicable, except as the schema of a regulative conception."
     "Besides, philosophy, as well as mathematics, treats of quantities; as, for example, of totality, infinity, and so on."
     "For pure reason never relates immediately to objects, but to the conceptions of these contained in the understanding."
     "For, although all the parts are contained in the intuition of the whole, the whole division is not contained therein."
     "With these principles it rises, in obedience to the laws of its own nature, to ever higher and more remote conditions."
     "But phenomena are only representations of things which are utterly unknown in respect to what they are in themselves."
     "Each of these main divisions will have its subdivisions, the separate reasons for which we cannot here particularize."
     "Experience is an empirical cognition; that is to say, a cognition which determines an object by means of perceptions."
     "I understand by a canon a list of the à priori principles of the proper employment of certain faculties of cognition."
     "If the intuition must conform to the nature of the objects, I do not see how we can know anything of them /à priori/."
     "Logicians formerly termed the universal, matter, the specific difference of this or that part of the universal, form."
     "No composite thing in the world consists of simple parts; and there does not exist in the world any simple substance."
     "Reason is benefited by the examination of a subject on both sides, and its judgements are corrected by being limited."
     "The opposite of that which is changed — the opposite of its state — is actual at another time, and is therefore possible."
     "Thus the conception of body indicates something — for example, metal — which can be cognized by means of that conception."
     "Thus we shall not be able to discover whether the things are identical or different, in agreement or opposition, etc."
     "Consequently, this conception is not a transcendental idea — and it is with these alone that we are at present occupied."
     "For, if it can be shown that but one inference from a proposition is false, then the proposition must itself be false."
     "For in the former case, it would be something real, yet without presenting to any power of perception any real object."
     "For these reasons it would be utterly hopeless to attempt to rob this argument of the authority it has always enjoyed."
     "For this science is nothing more than the inventory of all that is given us by /pure reason/, systematically arranged."
     "Hence it follows that an à priori intuition (which is not empirical) lies at the root of all our conceptions of space."
     "In an analytical judgement I do not go beyond the given conception, in order to arrive at some decision respecting it."
     "Such an analysis, indeed, executed with great particularity, may already be found in well-known works on this subject."
     "The non-sensuous cause of these representations is completely unknown to us and hence cannot be intuited as an object."
     "There cannot, therefore, be a completeness of series on the side of the causes which originate the one from the other."
     "There does not then exist any rational psychology as a doctrine furnishing any addition to our knowledge of ourselves."
     "This is the logical criterion of possibility, distinguishing the object of such a conception from the nihil negativum."
     "This unity, although a mere idea, thinkers have found it necessary rather to moderate the desire than to encourage it."
     "Time, therefore, is not a thing in itself, nor is it any objective determination pertaining to, or inherent in things."
     "Without the sensuous faculty no object would be given to us, and without the understanding no object would be thought."
     "But the proper place for all such arguments is a transcendent philosophy, which has unhappily not yet been established."
     "For phenomena are nothing but an empirical synthesis in apprehension or perception, and are therefore given only in it."
     "At the same time, there is still much room for improvement in the /exposition/ of the doctrines contained in this work."
     "Causality according to the laws of nature, is not the only causality operating to originate the phenomena of the world."
     "For in that case, this form of the inward intuition can be represented prior to the objects, and consequently à priori."
     "Hence the schema is properly only the phenomenon, or the sensuous conception of an object in harmony with the category."
     "In such a case, we should have nothing but a play of representations, which would possess no application to any object."
     "It is a logical postulate of reason: to pursue, as far as possible, the connection of a conception with its conditions."
     "Now with this view all empirical use of our faculty of cognition in the determination of time is in perfect accordance."
     "On the other hand, as an object of the pure understanding, every substance must have internal determination and forces."
     "Practical laws, in so far as they are subjective grounds of actions, that is, subjective principles, are termed maxims."
     "Pure understanding distinguishes itself not merely from everything empirical, but also completely from all sensibility."
     "That whose coherence with the real is determined according to universal conditions of experience is (exists) necessary."
     "The effect of an object upon the faculty of representation, so far as we are affected by the said object, is sensation."
     "The former of these parties gains this advantage, that they keep the sphere of phenomena free for mathematical science."
     "The three dynamical relations then, from which all others spring, are those of inherence, consequence, and composition."
     "Thus space and time were the intelligible form of the connection of things (substances and their states) in themselves."
     "Transcendental reflection is a duty which no one can neglect who wishes to establish an à priori judgement upon things."
     "We cannot discover any such practical interest arising from pure principles of reason as morality and religion present."
     "A conception formed from notions, which transcends the possibility of experience, is an idea, or a conception of reason."
     "As the idea provides a rule, so the ideal serves as an archetype for the perfect and complete determination of the copy."
     "But a subjective deduction of them from the nature of our reason is possible, and has been given in the present chapter."
     "For that which is not in the sum of the possible, and consequently requires to be added to it, is manifestly impossible."
     "Hence our conclusion differed from that given above; for we inferred in the antithesis the actual infinity of the world."
     "Hence it is absurd to have an opinion in pure mathematics; we must know, or abstain from forming a judgement altogether."
     "If I regard the earth, as it really appears to my senses, as a flat surface, I am ignorant how far this surface extends."
     "If this is admitted, you will have apparently gained the day, but in reality have enounced nothing but a mere tautology."
     "If we wish to call this object a noumenon, because the representation of it is non-sensuous, we are at liberty to do so."
     "If, however, we wish to employ these conceptions in respect of objects, previous transcendental reflection is necessary."
     "But as mere representations, they stand under no law of conjunction except that which the conjoining faculty prescribes."
     "But, at the same time, it marks out and defines both the external boundaries and the internal structure of this science."
     "General logic is constructed upon a plan which coincides exactly with the division of the higher faculties of cognition."
     "In the former case, the dogmatist must take care that his arguments possess the apodeictic certainty of a demonstration."
     "In the major it is considered as relating and applying to objects in general, consequently to objects of intuition also."
     "Now this, according to the laws of sensibility, and consequently in the case of objects of sense, is utterly impossible."
     "Such are the moral laws; and these alone belong to the sphere of the practical exercise of reason, and admit of a canon."
     "This would also form a ground of distinction between the modes of solution employed for the third and fourth antinomies."
     "We must join in thought a certain predicate to a given conception, and this necessity cleaves already to the conception."
     "A verbal definition of the conception is certainly easy enough: it is something the non-existence of which is impossible."
     "All the other subjects with which it occupies itself, are merely means for the attainment and realization of these ideas."
     "But if I insist on basing nature upon the foundation of a supreme ordaining Being, the unity of nature is in effect lost."
     "But it is neither finite nor infinite — as has been shown, on the one side, by the thesis, on the other, by the antithesis."
     "But the quantity of the universe is not thereby determined, and we cannot affirm that this regress proceeds in infinitum."
     "For it remains as a permanent quantity, whether I deny the infinite or the finite regress in the series of its phenomena."
     "A judgement, therefore, is the mediate cognition of an object, consequently the representation of a representation of it."
     "But, by such an employment of the transcendental idea, we should be over stepping the limits of its validity and purpose."
     "Conceptions which afford us the objective foundation of the possibility of experience are for that very reason necessary."
     "Conceptions, then, are based on the spontaneity of thought, as sensuous intuitions are on the receptivity of impressions."
     "David Hume perceived that, to render this possible, it was necessary that the conceptions should have an à priori origin."
     "For accidents (in so far as they inhere in a substance) are co-ordinated with each other, and do not constitute a series."
     "I shall persuade myself, then, that I have readers who do not wish to see a righteous cause defended by unfair arguments."
     "It is to be added, that the third category in each triad always arises from the combination of the second with the first."
     "The greatest, and perhaps the only, use of all philosophy of pure reason is, accordingly, of a purely negative character."
     "We cogitate in it merely its relation to an arbitrarily assumed unit, in relation to which it is greater than any number."
     "We have, therefore, contented ourselves with a merely critical remark, leaving the subject to be explained in the sequel."
     "A body is consequently divisible to infinity, though it does not, for that reason, consist of an infinite number of parts."
     "But it is plain that this continuity of forms is a mere idea, to which no adequate object can be discovered in experience."
     "But there are cases in which a similar misunderstanding cannot be provided against, and the dispute must remain unsettled."
     "Hence such judgements may be obviously false, and yet, taken problematically, be conditions of our cognition of the truth."
     "In other words, the objective relation of the successive phenomena remains quite undetermined by means of mere perception."
     "In the next place I subsume a cognition under the condition of the rule (and this is the minor) by means of the judgement."
     "In the second place, no à priori conception, such as those of substance, cause, right, fitness, and so on, can be defined."
     "Now an universal criterion of truth would be that which is valid for all cognitions, without distinction of their objects."
     "Persuasion is a mere illusion, the ground of the judgement, which lies solely in the subject, being regarded as objective."
     "The antinomy which reveals itself in the application of laws, is for our limited wisdom the best criterion of legislation."
     "The proof, from the mere idea of a supreme being, belongs to another principle of reason and requires separate discussion."
     "The schema of cause and of the causality of a thing is the real which, when posited, is always followed by something else."
     "The simple but empirically determined consciousness of my own existence proves the existence of external objects in space."
     "The singular judgement relates to the general one, as unity to infinity, and is therefore in itself essentially different."
     "These are certainly something, as forms of intuition, but are not themselves objects which are intuited (ens imaginarium)."
     "This kind of opposition I may be allowed to term dialectical; that of contradictories may be called analytical opposition."
     "What modi of the pure conceptions of reason these transcendental ideas are will be fully exposed in the following chapter."
     "Both conclusions were perfectly correct, according to the point of view from which the motions of the moon were considered."
     "But the idea of it lies in the reason — be it possible or impossible to connect with the idea adequate empirical conceptions."
     "For the common understanding thus finds itself in a situation where not even the most learned can have the advantage of it."
     "For we can understand nothing that does not bring with it something in intuition corresponding to the expressions employed."
     "If a judgement is valid for every rational being, then its ground is objectively sufficient, and it is termed a conviction."
     "By means of analysis different representations are brought under one conception — an operation of which general logic treats."
     "Certain philosophers have, nevertheless, allowed themselves the liberty of making such a saltus (metabasis eis allo gonos)."
     "In all changes of phenomena, substance is permanent, and the quantum thereof in nature is neither increased nor diminished."
     "In this case the distinction between a progressus in infinitum and a progressus in indefinitum is a mere piece of subtlety."
     "It is only of objective validity in regard to phenomena, because these are things which we regard as objects of our senses."
     "It is, moreover, not necessary that we should limit the mode of intuition in space and time to the sensuous faculty of man."
     "Now, let us stop here and admit it to be at least possible that reason does stand in a really causal relation to phenomena."
     "Such properties as belong to objects as things in themselves never can be presented to us through the medium of the senses."
     "The conception of an ens realissimum is that which best agrees with the conception of an unconditioned and necessary being."
     "The first step in regard to the subjects of pure reason, and which marks the infancy of that faculty, is that of dogmatism."
     "The hypothetical exercise of reason by the aid of ideas employed as problematical conceptions is properly not constitutive."
     "The principle of these is: Experience is possible only through the representation of a necessary connection of Perceptions."
     "There is no other way than through intuitions or conceptions, as such; and these are given either à priori or à posteriori."
     "This is not merely a prudential rule, it is essential to the very possibility of the proof of a transcendental proposition."
     "Time and space are, therefore, two sources of knowledge, from which, à priori, various synthetical cognitions can be drawn."
     "But the matter of phenomena, by which things are given in space and time, can be presented only in perception, à posteriori."
     "Change is the connection of determinations contradictorily opposed to each other in the existence of one and the same thing."
     "For the member at which we have discontinued our division still admits a regress to many more parts contained in the object."
     "Hence the investigation of nature receives a teleological direction, and becomes, in its widest extension, physico-theology."
     "All unsuccessful dogmatical attempts of reason are facia, which it is always useful to submit to the censure of the sceptic."
     "By the word function I understand the unity of the act of arranging diverse representations under one common representation."
     "Cognition from principles, then, is that cognition in which I cognize the particular in the general by means of conceptions."
     "In a word, all requisites for a complete and necessary determination of these actions must be presented to us by experience."
     "Now there are only two ways in which a necessary harmony of experience with the conceptions of its objects can be cogitated."
     "Now, consciousness in time is necessarily connected with the consciousness of the possibility of this determination in time."
     "Now, in the first place, if we have a proposition which contains the idea of necessity in its very conception, it is priori."
     "The first merely banishes the simple from the intuition of the composite; while the second drives it entirely out of nature."
     "The mode of adjusting a dispute which cannot be decided upon its own merits, we shall now proceed to lay before our readers."
     "The opposition of these two consists therefore in the difference of one and the same time, as a time filled or a time empty."
     "The permanence of the soul, therefore, as an object of the internal sense, remains undemonstrated, nay, even indemonstrable."
     "These principles cannot be derived from experience, for it would give neither strict universality, nor apodeictic certainty."
     "Thus it indicates a relationship between the different branches or species, in so far as they all spring from the same stem."
     "Thus we are obliged to acknowledge the existence of a chain of causes, in which, however, absolute totality cannot be found."
     "Consequently, the determination of my existence in time is possible only through the existence of real things external to me."
     "For the world is not given in its totality in any intuition: consequently, its quantity cannot be given prior to the regress."
     "For, in the absence of this supposition, it could not expect its ideas to produce certain effects in the world of experience."
     "Detection and Explanation of the Dialectical Illusion in all Transcendental Arguments for the Existence of a Necessary Being."
     "For in mere succession, existence is perpetually vanishing and recommencing, and therefore never has even the least quantity."
     "For in the understanding alone is the unity of experience, in which all perceptions must have their assigned place, possible."
     "From all that has been said, there results the idea of a particular science, which may be called the Critique of Pure Reason."
     "Indeed, it could not possess universal validity, inasmuch as it would not in this case be à priori, but founded on deduction."
     "It is, then, in its practical, but especially in its moral use, that the principles of pure reason possess objective reality."
     "On the above supposition, it follows that there must have been a time in which the world did not exist, that is, a void time."
     "Our duty at present is to exhibit in systematic connection those judgements which the understanding really produces à priori."
     "Some few principles preposited by geometricians are, indeed, really analytical, and depend on the principle of contradiction."
     "Synthetical cognitions from conceptions the understanding cannot supply, and they alone are entitled to be called principles."
     "The analytical criterion of possibility, which consists in the absence of contradiction in propositions, cannot be denied it."
     "The highest conception, with which a transcendental philosophy commonly begins, is the division into possible and impossible."
     "The latter is, accordingly, rather an auxiliary to an argument, than a strictly philosophical and rational mode of procedure."
     "There are no attempts made at deciding what the ground of this unity may be, or what the real nature of this imaginary being."
     "To this perfection it is, therefore, bound, as the fundamental science, to attain, and to it the maxim may justly be applied:"
     "We may and must, therefore, regard the attempts hitherto made to establish metaphysical science dogmatically as non-existent."
     "We shall accordingly have to treat of the discipline, the canon, the architectonic, and, finally, the history of pure reason."
     "What we cognize in matter is nothing but relations (what we call its internal determinations are but comparatively internal)."
     "Whether they succeed one another in the object also, is a second point for reflection, which was not contained in the former."
     "Without this they possess no objective validity, but are mere play of imagination or of understanding with images or notions."
     "And thus the practical idea is always in the highest degree fruitful, and in relation to real actions indispensably necessary."
     "But all the questions raised by pure reason relate to that which lies beyond this horizon, or, at least, in its boundary line."
     "From this we perceive the possibility of cognizing à priori a law of changes — a law, however, which concerns their form merely."
     "I will not here enter upon any literary investigation of the sense which this sublime philosopher attached to this expression."
     "According to the idea of reason, the whole past time, as the condition of the given moment, is necessarily cogitated as given."
     "As we now proceed to the exposition of the employment of these, I shall not designate the chapters in this manner any further."
     "At all events, we could not dispute with any one on that which merely depends on the manner in which his subject is organized."
     "But the propositions of the antithesis are of a character which renders the completion of an edifice of cognitions impossible."
     "If we are to form a synthetical judgement regarding a conception, we must go beyond it, to the intuition in which it is given."
     "In this way he might have been able to describe the determinate limits of the à priori operations of understanding and reason."
     "It follows that an infinite given quantity, consequently an infinite world (both as regards time and extension) is impossible."
     "It is true that we had to discuss the question of an apparent antithetic, but we found that it was based upon a misconception."
     "Now, although we believe the action to have been determined by all these circumstances, we do not the less blame the offender."
     "Of all the cosmological ideas, however, it is that occasioning the fourth antinomy which compels us to venture upon this step."
     "Synthetical propositions, which relate to things in general, an à priori intuition of which is impossible, are transcendental."
     "The case is very different with those principles whose province it is to subject the existence of phenomena to rules à priori."
     "The logic of the particular use of the understanding contains the laws of correct thinking upon a particular class of objects."
     "The physician must pursue some course in the case of a patient who is in danger, but is ignorant of the nature of the disease."
     "The second peculiarity of transcendental proof is that a transcendental proposition cannot rest upon more than a single proof."
     "This combination — not an arbitrary one — I entitle dynamical because it concerns the connection of the existence of the manifold."
     "This distinction does not at present seem to be of particular importance, but we shall afterwards find it to be of some value."
     "Thus everything that happens is but a continuation of a series, and an absolute beginning is impossible in the sensuous world."
     "Thus this argument is utterly insufficient for the task before us — a demonstration of the existence of an all-sufficient being."
     "We shall now proceed to investigate the sources of all these attempts of reason to establish the existence of a Supreme Being."
     "And, in relation to substance, they are not properly subordinated to it, but are the mode of existence of the substance itself."
     "But it is very easy to embarrass them by the introduction of counter-possibilities, which rest upon quite as good a foundation."
     "But this is not the case with substance in the phenomenal world, which is not a thing in itself cogitated by the pure category."
     "Ideas are, according to him, archetypes of things themselves, and not merely keys to possible experiences, like the categories."
     "All your endeavours are in vain, and you find yourself forced to have recourse to intuition, as, in fact, geometry always does."
     "Before entering on this task, however, the following general remark may help to quicken our attention to this mode of argument."
     "If, however, we neglect this restriction of the idea to a purely regulative influence, reason is betrayed into numerous errors."
     "It follows that the conception of the ens realissimum is the only conception by and in which we can cogitate a necessary being."
     "Now comes the question whether the manifold of this house is in itself successive — which no one will be at all willing to grant."
     "Of these dialectical arguments there are three kinds, corresponding to the number of the ideas which their conclusions present."
     "Of this we find a striking example in the cognitions of space and its relations, which form the foundation of pure mathematics."
     "Particular errors may be corrected by particular animadversions, and the causes of these errors may be eradicated by criticism."
     "Reason avails itself of the conception of the understanding for the sole purpose of producing totality in the different series."
     "That which cannot be cogitated otherwise than as subject, does not exist otherwise than as subject, and is therefore substance."
     "The application of these categories to the Ego would, however, be necessary, if I wished to make myself an object of knowledge."
     "The conceptions of reason are, as we have already shown, mere ideas, and do not relate to any object in any kind of experience."
     "The glass is the cause of the rising of the water above its horizontal surface, although the two phenomena are contemporaneous."
     "This latter remark, however, must be taken only as an illustration, and not as any proof of the truth of our æsthetical theory."
     "Thus all errors of subreptio — of misapplication, are to be ascribed to defects of judgement, and not to understanding or reason."
     "Thus, for example, that which is intrinsically impossible, is also impossible in all relations, that is, absolutely impossible."
     "Thus, pure reason, in the sphere of speculation, does not contain a single direct synthetical judgement based upon conceptions."
     "We expect, therefore, to find in it a determinate, but at the same time, infinite, number of parts — which is self-contradictory."
     "But this is not tantamount to declaring that the thinking Ego is a simple substance — for this would be a synthetical proposition."
     "Either is the death of a sound philosophy, although the former might perhaps deserve the title of the euthanasia of pure reason."
     "If this thing is annihilated in thought, the internal possibility of the thing is also annihilated, which is self-contradictory."
     "If a conception could not be employed in reasoning before it had been defined, it would fare ill with all philosophical thought."
     "As my present aim is not to set forth a complete system, but merely the principles of one, I reserve this task for another time."
     "But all this is quite possible when we regard time as merely the subjective condition under which all our intuitions take place."
     "But in this case, no object is given them, and therefore they have no meaning sufficient to afford us a conception of an object."
     "I understand by idea a necessary conception of reason, to which no corresponding object can be discovered in the world of sense."
     "In the transcendental sphere of reason, on the other hand, the term opinion is too weak, while the word knowledge is too strong."
     "It assumed that the only immediate experience is internal and that from this we can only infer the existence of external things."
     "On the other hand, it is sometimes employed to indicate that a thing is valid in all respects — for example, absolute sovereignty."
     "Such propositions, then, cannot be termed axioms (for in that case we should have an infinity of these), but numerical formulae."
     "The expression not mortal does not indicate that a non-being is cogitated in the object; it does not concern the content at all."
     "The former may be termed the character of the thing as a phenomenon, the latter the character of the thing as a thing in itself."
     "The quality of sensation is in all cases merely empirical, and cannot be represented à priori (for example, colours, taste, etc."
     "Thus the predicates of space and time are rightly attributed to objects of the senses as such, and in this there is no illusion."
     "He endeavoured to prove in his Phaedo, that the soul cannot be annihilated, by showing that a simple being cannot cease to exist."
     "All substances, in so far as they can be perceived in space at the same time, exist in a state of complete reciprocity of action."
     "Being is evidently not a real predicate, that is, a conception of something which is added to the conception of some other thing."
     "By means of the external sense (a property of the mind), we represent to ourselves objects as without us, and these all in space."
     "Logicians say, with justice, that in the use of judgements in syllogisms, singular judgements may be treated like universal ones."
     "My definition of such a conception would with more propriety be termed a declaration of a project than a definition of an object."
     "Now, it is the fashion of the time to heap contempt and scorn upon her; and the matron mourns, forlorn and forsaken, like Hecuba:"
     "Space (filled or void) may therefore be limited by phenomena, but phenomena cannot be limited by an empty space without them."
     "The example which he set served to awaken that spirit of profound and thorough investigation which is not yet extinct in Germany."
     "The former confines itself to the general conceptions; the latter can do nothing with a mere conception, it hastens to intuition."
     "The simple — that which can be represented by a unit — is therefore the foundation of that which is internal in things in themselves."
     "These are the conceptions of space and time as forms of sensibility, and the categories as pure conceptions of the understanding."
     "These may all be annihilated in thought, but time itself, as the universal condition of their possibility, cannot be so annulled."
     "To prove this, we should require not a mere analysis of the proposition, but synthetical judgements based upon a given intuition."
     "Every limited part of space presented to intuition is a whole, the parts of which are always spaces — to whatever extent subdivided."
     "All phenomena, then, are continuous quantities, in respect both to intuition and mere perception (sensation, and with it reality)."
     "Arithmetical propositions are therefore always synthetical, of which we may become more clearly convinced by trying large numbers."
     "But we can reduce all acts of the understanding to judgements, so that understanding may be represented as the faculty of judging."
     "For all that is practical, so far as it contains motives, relates to feelings, and these belong to empirical sources of cognition."
     "For metaphysics has to deal only with principles and with the limitations of its own employment as determined by these principles."
     "I call all representations pure, in the transcendental meaning of the word, wherein nothing is met with that belongs to sensation."
     "I can cognize beforehand by analysis the conception of body through the characteristics of extension, impenetrability, shape, etc."
     "If we join the limitation of a judgement to the conception of the subject, then the judgement will possess unconditioned validity."
     "In one word, a full and clear definition ought, in philosophy, rather to form the conclusion than the commencement of our labours."
     "Reality, in contradistinction to negation, can be explained only by cogitating a time which is either filled therewith or is void."
     "The reader will observe, that in the foregoing proof the game which idealism plays is retorted upon itself, and with more justice."
     "We do not enlarge but disfigure the sciences when we lose sight of their respective limits and allow them to run into one another."
     "And thus scepticism, the bane of dogmatical philosophy, conducts us to a sound investigation into the understanding and the reason."
     "Concluding Remark on the Solution of the Transcendental Mathematical Ideas — and Introductory to the Solution of the Dynamical Ideas."
     "Examples are thus the go-cart of the judgement, which he who is naturally deficient in that faculty cannot afford to dispense with."
     "From these elements originate all the conceptions of pure psychology, by combination alone, without the aid of any other principle."
     "I consider the division by paragraphs to be necessary only up to this point, because we had to treat of the elementary conceptions."
     "I shall analyse these conceptions only so far as is necessary for the doctrine of method, which is to form a part of this critique."
     "It has to do neither with shape nor position; on the contrary, it determines the relation of representations in our internal state."
     "It is very plain that reason attains to a cognition, by means of acts of the understanding which constitute a series of conditions."
     "Mathematical science affords us a brilliant example, how far, independently of all experience, we may carry our à priori knowledge."
     "Now, as this regress is infinite, all the members (parts) to which it attains must be contained in the given whole as an aggregate."
     "Now, logic in its turn may be considered as twofold — namely, as logic of the general, or of the particular use of the understanding."
     "Reality is something; negation is nothing, that is, a conception of the absence of an object, as cold, a shadow (nihil privativum)."
     "The absolute totality of this series would be actually attained and given to the mind, if the regress could arrive at simple parts."
     "Therefore, neither in the world, nor out of it (but in causal connection with it), does there exist any absolutely necessary being."
     "They may be termed, though improperly, sensuous ideals, as they are declared to be models of certain possible empirical intuitions."
     "This deduction will complete the critical task imposed upon pure reason; and it is to this part Of our labours that we now proceed."
     "This is also an analytical proposition, for other things are exactly those which I think as different or distinguished from myself."
     "To things as things in themselves, conformability to law must necessarily belong independently of an understanding to cognize them."
     "When something happens, the mere fact of the occurrence, without regard to that which occurs, is an object requiring investigation."
     "But although a definition cannot be incorrect, as regards its content, an error may sometimes, although seldom, creep into the form."
     "For the conception is given only in and through the definition, and thus it contains only what has been cogitated in the definition."
     "Every conception is, in relation to that which is not contained in it, undetermined and subject to the principle of determinability."
     "For neither in the representation of seven, nor of five, nor of the composition of the two numbers, do I cogitate the number twelve."
     "In the absence of this security, indifference, doubt, and finally, severe criticism are rather signs of a profound habit of thought."
     "It follows from what we have said that we are not justified in declaring the world to be infinite in space, or as regards past time."
     "The word community has in our language two meanings, and contains the two notions conveyed in the Latin communio and commercium."
     "There exists either in, or in connection with the world — either as a part of it, or as the cause of it — an absolutely necessary being."
     "Thus we cogitate — and necessarily — a given time completely elapsed up to a given moment, although that time is not determinable by us."
     "Both have, in reality, been struggling for the twofold interest of reason; the one maintaining the one interest, the other the other."
     "But I cannot for this reason say that I cognize this property of a straight line from principles — I cognize it only in pure intuition."
     "For the assertion that the reality of such ideas is probable is as absurd as a proof of the probability of a proposition in geometry."
     "Here, therefore, the order in the sequence of perceptions in apprehension is determined; and by this order apprehension is regulated."
     "If we admit the existence of some one thing, whatever it may be, we must also admit that there is something which exists necessarily."
     "In an object, the composite parts thereof (essentialia) are the matter; the mode in which they are connected in the object, the form."
     "In the major we speak of a being that can be cogitated generally and in every relation, consequently as it may be given in intuition."
     "Now, independently of sensibility, we cannot possibly have any intuition; consequently, the understanding is no faculty of intuition."
     "Suppose, then, that space and time are in themselves objective, and conditions of the — possibility of objects as things in themselves."
     "The condition was always a member of the series along with the conditioned, and thus the homogeneity of the whole series was assured."
     "The topic of the rational doctrine of the soul, from which everything else it may contain must be deduced, is accordingly as follows:"
     "This law of specification cannot be deduced from experience; it can never present us with a principle of so universal an application."
     "Thus we have gained nothing as regards the cognition of myself as object, by the analysis of the consciousness of my Self in thought."
     "We must therefore hold the principle of contradiction to be the universal and fully sufficient Principle of all analytical cognition."
     "But a transcendental paralogism has a transcendental foundation, and concludes falsely, while the form is correct and unexceptionable."
     "But it cannot be said of reason, that the state in which it determines the will is always preceded by some other state determining it."
     "For one naturally arms oneself to resist an attack, and becomes more obstinate in the resolve to establish the claims he has advanced."
     "For example, I may compute the light of the sun, and say that its quantity is a certain number of times greater than that of the moon."
     "For neither coexistence nor succession would be perceived by us, if the representation of time did not exist as a foundation à priori."
     "In support of this strange assertion, he referred us to the generally acknowledged principle of the relation between cause and effect."
     "It is absurd to expect to be enlightened by Reason, and at the same time to prescribe to her what side of the question she must adopt."
     "On the contrary, the absolute necessity of a judgement is only a conditioned necessity of a thing, or of the predicate in a judgement."
     "Our representations must be given previously to any analysis of them; and no conceptions can arise, quoad their content, analytically."
     "The advantage is completely on the side of Pneumatism; although this theory itself passes into naught, in the crucible of pure reason."
     "The aim of rational conceptions is the comprehension, as that of the conceptions of understanding is the understanding of perceptions."
     "The former — external objects in space — might be a mere delusion, but the latter — the object of my internal perception — is undeniably real."
     "This faculty is therefore the specific quality of the so-called mother wit, the want of which no scholastic discipline can compensate."
     "This property of quantities, according to which no part of them is the smallest possible (no part simple), is called their continuity."
     "Thus it rises from this world to a supreme intelligence, either as the principle of all natural, or of all moral order and perfection."
     "And thus Leibnitz regarded space as a certain order in the community of substances, and time as the dynamical sequence of their states."
     "But every effective cause must possess a character, that is to say, a law of its causality, without which it would cease to be a cause."
     "But in this representation we cannot find any knowledge of the subject, and therefore also no empirical knowledge, that is, experience."
     "For, in this case, it is quite foreign and unessential to the nature of things, and cannot be cognized from the general laws of nature."
     "If we permit ourselves to be deceived by the illusion of transcendental idealism, we shall find that neither nature nor freedom exists."
     "But empirical cognition is experience; consequently no à priori cognition is possible for us, except of objects of possible experience."
     "For it is in reality vain to profess /indifference/ in regard to such inquiries, the object of which cannot be indifferent to humanity."
     "In the latter case, the definition is necessarily defective, because we can never be fully certain of the completeness of our analysis."
     "It is only in time that it is possible to meet with two contradictorily opposed determinations in one thing, that is, after each other."
     "Let it not be supposed, however, that the third category is merely a deduced, and not a primitive conception of the pure understanding."
     "Secondly, it is properly the unconditioned alone that reason seeks in this serially and regressively conducted synthesis of conditions."
     "Such an existence is, in this case, too large for our empirical conception, and unattainable by the continued regress of any synthesis."
     "The modus tollens of reasoning from known inferences to the unknown proposition, is not only a rigorous, but a very easy mode of proof."
     "There would arise, indeed, a real contradiction, if reason came forward with a statement on the negative side of these questions alone."
     "This permanence is, however, nothing but the manner in which we represent to ourselves the existence of things in the phenomenal world."
     "Thus the given conceptions of cause and event will not be sufficient for the demonstration of the proposition: Every event has a cause."
     "Thus, when a body moves in a uniform manner, it does not change its state (of motion); but only when all motion increases or decreases."
     "With this purpose, we reason from an actual existence — an experience in general, to an absolutely necessary condition of that existence."
     "Without the control of criticism, reason is, as it were, in a state of nature, and can only establish its claims and assertions by war."
     "For how can we know all the possible cases that may arise? some of which may, however, prove exceptions to the universality of the rule."
     "For it is not the idea itself, but only the employment of the idea in relation to possible experience, that is transcendent or immanent."
     "For the idea is a creation of reason itself, which therefore cannot disclaim the obligation to answer or refer us to the unknown object."
     "I look about for the cause, and find it to be the fire, Now the fire as the cause is simultaneous with its effect, the heat of the room."
     "In transcendental cognition, so long as we are dealing only with conceptions of the understanding, we are guided by possible experience."
     "Now I cannot obtain the least representation of a thinking being by means of external experience, but solely through self-consciousness."
     "Our critique must, indeed, lay before us a complete enumeration of all the radical conceptions which constitute the said pure knowledge."
     "Persuasion I may keep for myself, if it is agreeable to me; but I cannot, and ought not, to attempt to impose it as binding upon others."
     "Space ought not to be called a compositum but a totum, for its parts are possible in the whole, and not the whole by means of the parts."
     "The understanding demands that something be given (at least in the conception), in order to be able to determine it in a certain manner."
     "This being (ens rationis ratiocinatae) is therefore a mere idea and is not assumed to be a thing which is real absolutely and in itself."
     "This procedure of subjecting the facta of reason to examination, and, if necessary, to disapproval, may be termed the censura of reason."
     "Thus it is only by means of our explanation that the possibility of geometry, as a synthetical science à priori, becomes comprehensible."
     "To prove this, we should require to know that the state of rest could have existed in the very same time in which the motion took place."
     "What things may be in themselves, I know not and need not know, because a thing is never presented to me otherwise than as a phenomenon."
     "What we have here said of the first cosmological idea — that of the absolute totality of quantity in phenomena — applies also to the others."
     "If the one is possible, so is the other; for reason recognizes that alone as absolutely necessary which is necessary from its conception."
     "For the external sense the pure image of all quantities (quantorum) is space; the pure image of all objects of sense in general, is time."
     "Let us assume that in a number of substances considered as phenomena each is completely isolated, that is, that no one acts upon another."
     "To make it complete, he who conducts himself in a manner not unworthy of happiness, must be able to hope for the possession of happiness."
     "We might go still farther, and discover new objections, or carry out to their extreme consequences those which have already been adduced."
     "Whatever be the content of our conception of an object, it is necessary to go beyond it, if we wish to predicate existence of the object."
     "Whatever number of motives nature may present to my will, whatever sensuous impulses — the moral ought it is beyond their power to produce."
     "When, therefore, the dogmatist advances with ten arguments in favour of a proposition, we may be sure that not one of them is conclusive."
     "All change is therefore possible only through a continuous action of the causality, which, in so far as it is uniform, we call a momentum."
     "An organon of pure reason would be a compendium of those principles according to which alone all pure cognitions à priori can be obtained."
     "It is opposed to the cognition of nature, which concerns only those objects or predicates which can be presented in a possible experience."
     "Nay, more, we may admit into the idea certain anthropomorphic elements, which are promotive of the interests of this regulative principle."
     "Now the reason of this again is that apperception, and with it thought, antecedes all possible determinate arrangement of representations."
     "So also, the application of space to objects in general would be transcendental; but if it be limited to objects of sense it is empirical."
     "The latter mode of thought is evidently based upon a logical principle, the aim of which is the systematic completeness of all cognitions."
     "The principle of these is: In all phenomena the Real, that which is an object of sensation, has Intensive Quantity, that is, has a Degree."
     "The second, which we have just mentioned, is that of scepticism, and it gives evidence that our judgement has been improved by experience."
     "The sphere of phenomena is the only sphere of their validity, and if we venture out of this, no further objective use can be made of them."
     "The thesis might also have been unfairly demonstrated, by the introduction of an erroneous conception of the infinity of a given quantity."
     "There is a great difference between a thing’s being presented to the mind as an object in an absolute sense, or merely as an ideal object."
     "They are conceptions of pure reason, for they regard all empirical cognition as determined by means of an absolute totality of conditions."
     "For it cannot be alleged that, instead of the laws of nature, laws of freedom may be introduced into the causality of the course of nature."
     "For, although not actually so expressed, the influence of such ideas of reason is very observable in the procedure of natural philosophers."
     "From this follows the impossibility of a definition on the basis of materialism of the constitution of my Ego as a merely thinking subject."
     "Hence those philosophers who adhere to the common opinion on this subject can never succeed in reconciling the ideas of nature and freedom."
     "I distinguish my own existence, as that of a thinking being, from that of other things external to me — among which my body also is reckoned."
     "I then proceed to cogitate this Supreme Being by conceptions which have, properly, no meaning or application, except in the world of sense."
     "If the question regarded an object of sense merely, it would be impossible for me to confound the conception with the existence of a thing."
     "An objective deduction, such as we were able to present in the case of the categories, is impossible as regards these transcendental ideas."
     "In mathematics such subreptions are impossible; and it is in this science, accordingly, that the indirect mode of proof has its true place."
     "It deals with mere conceptions — not, like mathematics, with conceptions applied to intuition — and in it, reason is the pupil of itself alone."
     "The science of mathematics presents the most brilliant example of the extension of the sphere of pure reason without the aid of experience."
     "This dialectical doctrine will not relate to the unity of understanding in empirical conceptions, but to the unity of reason in pure ideas."
     "This proof, termed by Leibnitz the argumentum a contingentia mundi, I shall now lay before the reader, and subject to a strict examination."
     "This unconditioned is always contained in the absolute totality of the series, when we endeavour to form a representation of it in thought."
     "This was essential to my purpose; and it thus became the accidental cause of my inability to do complete justice to the second requirement."
     "Whether I can be empirically conscious of the manifold as coexistent or as successive, depends upon circumstances, or empirical conditions."
     "A transcendental deduction of them cannot be made; such a deduction being always impossible in the case of ideas, as has been already shown."
     "Both modes have the properties of universality and an à priori origin in common, but are, in their procedure, of widely different character."
     "Consequently phenomena in the world are conditionally limited, but the world itself is not limited, either conditionally or unconditionally."
     "Consequently, everything that happens presupposes a previous condition, which it follows with absolute certainty, in conformity with a rule."
     "For merely to imagine also an external sense, would annihilate the faculty of intuition itself which is to be determined by the imagination."
     "For this reason, it is not a dogma; although from another point of view, that of experience, it is capable of being proved to demonstration."
     "But the conception of conjunction includes, besides the conception of the manifold and of the synthesis of it, that of the unity of it also."
     "In this manner I might have conducted my proof; but the conception given in it does not agree with the true conception of an infinite whole."
     "My readers would remark in the propositions of the antithesis a complete uniformity in the mode of thought and a perfect unity of principle."
     "On this point, I need only refer the reader to what I have said at the commencement of the General Remark appended to the foregoing chapter."
     "The divisibility of a body rests upon the divisibility of space, which is the condition of the possibility of the body as an extended whole."
     "The same science finds support and significance in number; this in its turn finds it in the fingers, or in counters, or in lines and points."
     "The series before us is therefore a series of conceptions, and not of intuitions (in which the one intuition is the condition of the other)."
     "This cause — even although it is regarded as absolutely necessary — must be presented to us in time, and must belong to the series of phenomena."
     "This connection can be hoped for only on the assumption that the cause of nature is a supreme reason, which governs according to moral laws."
     "To reach this limit by empirical means is impossible, and all attempts to determine it à priori according to a principle, are alike in vain."
     "We find that we possess nothing permanent that can correspond and be submitted to the conception of a substance as intuition, except matter."
     "But of this regress I know nothing more than that I ought to proceed from every given member of the series of conditions to one still higher."
     "But this would require a very different meaning in the words, a meaning which could not apply to phenomena as objects of possible experience."
     "For a certain degree of consciousness, which may not, however, be sufficient for recollection, is to be met with in many dim representations."
     "If we consider merely their extension, and whether they are adequate with ideas, the series of conditions may be regarded as all homogeneous."
     "All phenomena contain, as regards their form, an intuition in space and time, which lies à priori at the foundation of all without exception."
     "For that this is possible, nay, that such a system is not of so great extent as to preclude the hope of its ever being completed, is evident."
     "I therefore really go out of and beyond the conception of matter, in order to think on to it something à priori, which I did not think in it."
     "I understand, then, by the transcendental doctrine of method, the determination of the formal conditions of a complete system of pure reason."
     "If we were to attribute succession to time itself, we should be obliged to cogitate another time, in which this succession would be possible."
     "If, moreover, it is not derived from any other proposition, unless from one equally involving the idea of necessity, it is absolutely priori."
     "In this respect, all dialectical representations of totality, in the series of conditions to a given conditioned, were perfectly homogeneous."
     "Now this representation of a general procedure of the imagination to present its image to a conception, I call the schema of this conception."
     "Such a proof is necessary, moreover, because without it the principle might be liable to the imputation of being a mere gratuitous assertion."
     "That is to say, the parts of the progression exist only in time, and by means of the synthesis thereof, and are not given antecedently to it."
     "The loss falls, in its whole extent, on the /monopoly of the schools/, but does not in the slightest degree touch the /interests of mankind/."
     "The one is not the correlate of the other in a synthesis, but they are vitally connected in the same empirical intuition, as matter and form."
     "The word absolute is at present frequently used to denote that something can be predicated of a thing considered in itself and intrinsically."
     "He has nothing before him but the conception of a figure enclosed within three right lines, and, consequently, with the same number of angles."
     "I cannot therefore find anything that is absolutely, but only what is comparatively internal, and which itself consists of external relations."
     "Accordingly, permanence is a necessary condition under which alone phenomena, as things or objects, are determinable in a possible experience."
     "But what frees us during the process of building from all apprehension or suspicion, and flatters us into the belief of its solidity, is this."
     "Either it may have to /determine/ the conception of the object — which must be supplied extraneously, or it may have to /establish its reality/."
     "Examples and illustrations always appeared to me necessary, and, in the first sketch of the Critique, naturally fell into their proper places."
     "For this is the proper duty of a transcendental philosophy; what remains is the logical treatment of the conceptions in philosophy in general."
     "In this case, then, there is no succession as regards time, between cause and effect, but they are simultaneous; and still the law holds good."
     "It follows that phenomena are not things in themselves, but are mere representations, which if not given in us — in perception — are non-existent."
     "It is the oldest of the sciences, and would still survive, even if all the rest were swallowed up in the abyss of an all-destroying barbarism."
     "It wishes, to speak in another way, to attain to completeness in the series of premisses, so as to render it unnecessary to presuppose others."
     "So far, then, as knowledge is concerned, thus much, at least, is established, that, in regard to those two problems, it lies beyond our reach."
     "The capacity for receiving representations (receptivity) through the mode in which we are affected by objects, objects, is called sensibility."
     "The conceptions of pure reason — we do not here speak of the possibility of them — are not obtained by reflection, but by inference or conclusion."
     "The cosmological ideas are therefore occupied with the totality of the regressive synthesis, and proceed in antecedentia, not in consequentia."
     "The principles of modality therefore predicate of a conception nothing more than the procedure of the faculty of cognition which generated it."
     "To establish the truth of the latter view, principles are requisite, which are not cosmological and do not proceed in the series of phenomena."
     "Transcendental analytic is the dissection of the whole of our à priori knowledge into the elements of the pure cognition of the understanding."
     "And, in this case, I cannot say that two states in a phenomenon follow one upon the other, but only that one apprehension follows upon another."
     "For such an object could not be represented either in space or in time; and without these conditions intuition or representation is impossible."
     "I can proceed to examine my conception in concreto, and to cognize, either à priori or a posterio, what I find in the object of the conception."
     "If this, and with it space as the à priori condition of the possibility of phenomena, is left out of view, the whole world of sense disappears."
     "And as our intuition is always sensuous, no object ever can be presented to us in experience, which does not come under the conditions of time."
     "But it contains at the same time a relation of community, in so far as all the propositions taken together fill up the sphere of the cognition."
     "But that in which our sensations are merely arranged, and by which they are susceptible of assuming a certain form, cannot be itself sensation."
     "But while reason can never decline to submit itself to the tribunal of criticism, it has not always cause to dread the judgement of this court."
     "But, in regard to objects of experience, that is absolutely necessary without which the experience of these objects would itself be impossible."
     "In this the procedure is exactly the same as that pursued in the investigation of the series of causes which determine a given physical effect."
     "It certainly seems that, as a body must be cogitated as substance in space, the law of divisibility would not be applicable to it as substance."
     "It is something very remarkable that, on the supposition that something exists, I cannot avoid the inference that something exists necessarily."
     "It is true that the mathematician occupies himself with objects and cognitions only in so far as they can be represented by means of intuition."
     "Pure reason has, therefore, nothing left but nature in general, and the completeness of conditions in nature in accordance with some principle."
     "Rules current in the field of common experience, and which common sense stamps everywhere with its approval, are regarded by them as axiomatic."
     "That is, it must determine à priori the consequences which are given in experience and which are supposed to follow from the hypothesis itself."
     "The transcendental conception of reason is therefore nothing else than the conception of the totality of the conditions of a given conditioned."
     "There are no other conceptions which can bear definition, except those which contain an arbitrary synthesis, which can be constructed à priori."
     "These again have a still higher end — the answer to the question, what we ought to do, if the will is free, if there is a God and a future world."
     "But with this we have not to do; our concern is only with the law of progression in experience, in which objects, that is, phenomena, are given."
     "Farther than this logic cannot go, and the error which depends not on the form, but on the content of the cognition, it has no test to discover."
     "For in that case they apply necessarily and à priori to objects of experience, because only through them can an object of experience be thought."
     "In such sciences it is not allowable to excuse ourselves on the plea of necessary and unavoidable ignorance; a solution is absolutely requisite."
     "Moral conceptions are not perfectly pure conceptions of reason, because an empirical element — of pleasure or pain — lies at the foundation of them."
     "Now, a natural illusion leads us to consider this principle, which is valid only of sensuous objects, as valid with regard to things in general."
     "On the other hand, the duty of transcendental logic is to reduce to conceptions, not representations, but the pure synthesis of representations."
     "Substances, in general, must have something inward, which is therefore free from external relations, consequently from that of composition also."
     "This mediating representation must be pure (without any empirical content), and yet must on the one side be intellectual, on the other sensuous."
     "A logical predicate may be what you please, even the subject may be predicated of itself; for logic pays no regard to the content of a judgement."
     "But such twisting of words is a mere sophistical subterfuge, to avoid a difficult question, by modifying its meaning to suit our own convenience."
     "But this, that is to say, the objective form of experience, contains all the kinds of synthesis which are requisite for the cognition of objects."
     "But we are speaking here merely of phenomena in space and time, both of which are determinations of sensibility, and not of things in themselves."
     "In an object of the pure understanding, only that is internal which has no relation (as regards its existence) to anything different from itself."
     "In relation to this criterion, therefore, we must suppose the idea of the systematic unity of nature to possess objective validity and necessity."
     "In the second, we do not speak of things, but of thought (all objects being abstracted), in which the Ego is always the subject of consciousness."
     "In this sphere, therefore, Reason is mistress of a possession, her title to which she does not require to prove — which, in fact, she could not do."
     "It is therefore a conception, for the reason alone that other representations are contained under it, by means of which it can relate to objects."
     "It is, therefore, quite correct to say that the senses do not err, not because they always judge correctly, but because they do not judge at all."
     "Moreover, there are deduced conceptions (actio, passio) enumerated among the original conceptions, and, of the latter, some are entirely wanting."
     "Now we can cogitate all the powers and faculties of the soul — even that of consciousness — as diminished by one half, the substance still remaining."
     "Now we have a conception of bodies only as phenomena, and, as such, they necessarily presuppose space as the condition of all external phenomena."
     "On the other hand, it is so far homogeneous with the phenomenon, inasmuch as time is contained in every empirical representation of the manifold."
     "Possible experience can alone give reality to our conceptions; without it a conception is merely an idea, without truth or relation to an object."
     "Still less is it a constitutive principle of reason authorizing us to extend our conception of the sensuous world beyond all possible experience."
     "That is to say, the consciousness of my own existence is at the same time an immediate consciousness of the existence of other things without me."
     "The objects of these questions contain no heterogeneous or contradictory elements, for they relate to things in themselves, and not to phenomena."
     "The possibility of such an infinite derivation, without any initial member from which all the others result, is certainly quite incomprehensible."
     "The restraint which is employed to repress, and finally to extirpate the constant inclination to depart from certain rules, is termed discipline."
     "The sacredness of religion, and the authority of legislation, are by many regarded as grounds of exemption from the examination of this tribunal."
     "The transcendental speculation of reason relates to three things: the freedom of the will, the immortality of the soul, and the existence of God."
     "They only serve to conceal errors and fallacies, and to deceive philosophy, whose duty it is to see that reason pursues a safe and straight path."
     "This is that an event cannot be determined in time, and consequently cannot form a part of experience, unless it stands under this dynamical law."
     "Thus the transcendental ideas are available only for ascending in the series of conditions, till we reach the unconditioned, that is, principles."
     "We cannot, at the same time, avoid regarding, by a transcendental subreptio, this formal principle as constitutive, and hypostatizing this unity."
     "A pure conception, in so far as it has its origin in the understanding alone, and is not the conception of a pure sensuous image, is called notio."
     "And thus the celebrated Leibnitz has utterly failed in his attempt to establish upon à priori grounds the possibility of this sublime ideal being."
     "And thus we find — what we could not discover in any empirical series — a condition of a successive series of events itself empirically unconditioned."
     "Besides, by this mode of induction we could not attain to the completeness which the magnitude and strict universality of the conception requires."
     "But ideas are still further removed from objective reality than categories; for no phenomenon can ever present them to the human mind in concreto."
     "But the real aim of reason in this procedure is the attainment of principles of systematic unity for the explanation of the phenomena of the soul."
     "For more conceptions of things, analyse them as we may, cannot enable us to conclude from the existence of one object to the existence of another."
     "All the powers of reason, in the sphere of what may be termed pure philosophy, are, in fact, directed to the three above-mentioned problems alone."
     "Hypotheses are, therefore, admissible in the sphere of pure reason only as weapons for self-defence, and not as supports to dogmatical assertions."
     "In like manner, the subject, in which the representation of time has its basis, cannot determine, for this very reason, its own existence in time."
     "In other words, whatever follows or happens, must follow in conformity with a universal rule upon that which was contained in the foregoing state."
     "In this view of the case, the whole field of experience, how far soever it may extend, contains nothing that is not subject to the laws of nature."
     "It is by means of the transcendental unity of apperception that all the manifold, given in an intuition is united into a conception of the object."
     "Let us then make the experiment whether we may not be more successful in metaphysics, if we assume that the objects must conform to our cognition."
     "Nevertheless, in respect of all phenomena, consequently of all things which come within the sphere of our experience, it is necessarily objective."
     "Now, this is impossible, unless I determine the object present to my mind according to the conditions, either of empirical, or of pure, intuition."
     "Perhaps, after they have wearied more than injured each other, they will discover the nothingness of their cause of quarrel and part good friends."
     "That the strictest laws of honesty should be observed in the discussion of a purely speculative subject is the least requirement that can be made."
     "The words I ought express a species of necessity, and imply a connection with grounds which nature does not and cannot present to the mind of man."
     "This world is, it is true, only an intelligible world; for of such a systematic unity of ends as it requires, the world of sense gives us no hint."
     "Thus the transcendental and only determinate conception of God, which is presented to us by speculative reason, is in the strictest sense deistic."
     "To one who has accustomed himself to these distinctions, it must be quite intolerable to hear the representation of the colour red called an idea."
     "We are not, however, entitled to affirm of a whole of this kind, which is divisible in infinitum, that it consists of an infinite number of parts."
     "We may proceed from a given pair in the descending line of generation from father to son, and cogitate a never-ending line of descendants from it."
     "But a representation is clear, in which our consciousness is sufficient for the consciousness of the difference of this representation from others."
     "For this reason an infinite aggregate of actual things cannot be considered as a given whole, consequently, not as a contemporaneously given whole."
     "How things may be in themselves, without regard to the representations through which they affect us, is utterly beyond the sphere of our cognition."
     "If, for example, I consider a leaden ball, which lies upon a cushion and makes a hollow in it, as a cause, then it is simultaneous with the effect."
     "Against this assertion, destructive to all pure philosophy, he would have been guarded, had he had our problem before his eyes in its universality."
     "Apprehension, by means of sensation alone, fills only one moment, that is, if I do not take into consideration a succession of many sensations."
     "But if we believe that everything in the world — be it condition or conditioned — is contingent; every given existence is too small for our conception."
     "In this there is no representation of its quantity, it is not said how large it is; consequently its conception is not the conception of a maximum."
     "Our knowledge of the existence of things reaches as far as our perceptions, and what may be inferred from them according to empirical laws, extend."
     "The conception of the shortest is therefore fore wholly an addition, and by no analysis can it be extracted from our conception of a straight line."
     "Thus there are maxims of speculative reason, which are based solely upon its speculative interest, although they appear to be objective principles."
     "By observation and analysis of phenomena we penetrate into the interior of nature, and no one can say what progress this knowledge may make in time."
     "For the declaration of this mental faculty may be that what has and could not but take place in the course of nature, ought not to have taken place."
     "I hope to avoid both extremes, by keeping as close as possible to the transcendental, and excluding all psychological, that is, empirical, elements."
     "I may thus be obliged to admit that all existing things have a necessary basis, while I cannot cogitate any single or individual thing as necessary."
     "For if the judgement is analytical, be it affirmative or negative, its truth must always be recognizable by means of the principle of contradiction."
     "For the major always gives a conception, through which everything that is subsumed under the condition thereof is cognized according to a principle."
     "For there are no other subjective representations from which we can deduce synthetical propositions à priori, as we can from the intuition of space."
     "In both, the /pure/ or /à priori/ element must be treated first, and must be carefully distinguished from that which is supplied from other sources."
     "Its permanence in life is evident, per se, inasmuch as the thinking being (as man) is to itself, at the same time, an object of the external senses."
     "On the contrary, it forms merely the problematical foundation of the connection which the mind introduces among the phenomena of the sensuous world."
     "Phenomena as objects of perception are not pure, that is, merely formal intuitions, like space and time, for they cannot be perceived in themselves."
     "Space is essentially one, and multiplicity in it, consequently the general notion of spaces, of this or that space, depends solely upon limitations."
     "The former alone can we cognize à priori, that is, antecedent to all actual perception; and for this reason such cognition is called pure intuition."
     "The sole aim of our remarks has, however, been to prove that internal experience in general is possible only through external experience in general."
     "The word reality in the conception of the thing, and the word existence in the conception of the predicate, will not help you out of the difficulty."
     "This, however, may be avoided, if we are sufficiently cautious in the construction of our fictions, which are not the less fictions on that account."
     "Thus, if I take away from our representation of a body all that the understanding thinks as belonging to it, as substance, force, divisibility, etc."
     "Thus, the law of succession of time is in all instances the only empirical criterion of effect in relation to the causality of the antecedent cause."
     "When experience is presupposed, these principles are apodeictically certain, but in themselves, and directly, they cannot even be cognized à priori."
     "A definition is, as the term itself indicates, the representation, upon primary grounds, of the complete conception of a thing within its own limits."
     "But all judgement, nay, all comparisons require reflection, that is, a distinction of the faculty of cognition to which the given conceptions belong."
     "But that relation of substances in which the one contains determinations the ground of which is in the other substance, is the relation of influence."
     "But these considerations of what is desirable in relation to our whole state, that is, is in the end good and useful, are based entirely upon reason."
     "But these have themselves objective reality, that is, they apply to possible things, because they contain à priori the form of experience in general."
     "But this is nothing more than saying: There exist subjects which are absolutely necessary — the very hypothesis which you are called upon to establish."
     "Freedom — independence of the laws of nature — is certainly a deliverance from restraint, but it is also a relinquishing of the guidance of law and rule."
     "I am only conscious, then, that my imagination places one state before and the other after; not that the one state antecedes the other in the object."
     "If light be not given to the senses, we cannot represent to ourselves darkness, and if extended objects are not perceived, we cannot represent space."
     "Experience no doubt teaches us that this or that object is constituted in such and such a manner, but not that it could not possibly exist otherwise."
     "For no cognition can contradict it, without losing at the same time all content, that is, losing all reference to an object, and therefore all truth."
     "For the generalness of the conception it never could attain to, as this includes under itself all triangles, whether right-angled, acute-angled, etc."
     "For, to do so, I must cognize this being as existing, and yet not in time, which — since I cannot support my conception by any intuition — is impossible."
     "Hence the empirical unity of consciousness by means of association of representations, itself relates to a phenomenal world and is wholly contingent."
     "Hence, with regard to those /conceptions/ and /principles/ which we assume /à priori/, our only course will be to view them from two different sides."
     "I perceive that phenomena succeed one another, that is to say, a state of things exists at one time, the opposite of which existed in a former state."
     "In the absence of intuition, our thought of an object may still have true and useful consequences in regard to the exercise of reason by the subject."
     "It follows that we are not required to answer the question respecting the absolute quantity of a series — whether it is in itself limited or unlimited."
     "Mathematics, too, treats of the difference of lines and surfaces — as spaces of different quality, of the continuity of extension — as a quality thereof."
     "No synthetical proposition of pure transcendental reason can be so evident, as is often rashly enough declared, as the statement, twice two are four."
     "Philosophical cognition, accordingly, regards the particular only in the general; mathematical the general in the particular, nay, in the individual."
     "The above is the general conception of the faculty of reason, in so far as it has been possible to make it comprehensible in the absence of examples."
     "The former alone is properly science, although short and dry, as the methodical exposition of an elemental doctrine of the understanding ought to be."
     "The predicate is valid for the whole conception just as if it were a general conception, and had extent, to the whole of which the predicate applied."
     "The same holds good of the notion of extinction, for this presupposes the empirical representation of a time, in which a phenomenon no longer exists."
     "Thus applied logic treats of attention, its impediments and consequences, of the origin of error, of the state of doubt, hesitation, conviction, etc."
     "But the wise man of the Stoics is an ideal, that is to say, a human being existing only in thought and in complete conformity with the idea of wisdom."
     "Consequently the coexistence of substances in space cannot be cognized in experience otherwise than under the precondition of their reciprocal action."
     "For if, in relation to this law, I have nothing more than opinion, my judgement is but a play of the imagination, without the least relation to truth."
     "It follows that what was valid in general under that condition must also be considered as valid in the particular case which satisfies this condition."
     "Now, as this case contradicts the supposition, the second must contain the truth — that the substantial composite in the world consists of simple parts."
     "On the other hand, the reality of the object of our internal sense (that is, myself and my internal state) is clear immediately through consciousness."
     "On the other hand, these very conditions (space and time) embarrass them greatly, when the understanding endeavours to pass the limits of that sphere."
     "Pure intuition consequently contains merely the form under which something is intuited, and pure conception only the form of the thought of an object."
     "They are like old but never superannuated claims; and we must seek them out, and settle them once and for ever, if we are to expect a permanent peace."
     "This argument continues, however, to possess a weight and an authority, which, in spite of its objective insufficiency, it has never been divested of."
     "This critique of reason has now taught us that all its efforts to extend the bounds of knowledge, by means of pure speculation, are utterly fruitless."
     "We have some reason, however, to expect that, in the only other way that lies open to it — the path of practical reason — it may meet with better success."
     "We may certainly collect from phenomena a law, according to which this or that usually happens, but the element of necessity is not to be found in it."
     "We therefore distinguish the science of the laws of sensibility, that is, æsthetic, from the science of the laws of the understanding, that is, logic."
     "A law of the affinity of all conceptions which prescribes a continuous transition from one species to every other by the gradual increase of diversity."
     "And, as it is a conception which occupies much of the attention of reason, its loss would be greatly to the detriment of all transcendental philosophy."
     "But if we are called upon to explain what we mean by substance, and wish to avoid the vice of reasoning in a circle, the answer is by no means so easy."
     "But this permanent something cannot be something in me, for the very reason that my existence in time is itself determined by this permanent something."
     "Consequently, the transcendental idea of the absolute totality of the series of the conditions of a given conditioned, relates merely to all past time."
     "Experience is itself a synthesis of perceptions; and it employs perceptions to increment the conception, which I obtain by means of another perception."
     "For pure reason leaves to the understanding everything that immediately relates to the object of intuition or rather to their synthesis in imagination."
     "For they do not satisfy all the aims which are natural to every rational being, and which are determined à priori by pure reason itself, and necessary."
     "All illusions in an argument are more easily detected when they are presented in the formal manner employed by the schools, which we now proceed to do."
     "But, although hypotheses are inadmissible in answers to the questions of pure speculative reason, they may be employed in the defence of these answers."
     "From this it is clear also that the representation of time is itself an intuition, because all its relations can be expressed in an external intuition."
     "In mathematics, it is à priori intuition that guides my synthesis; and, in this case, all our conclusions may be drawn immediately from pure intuition."
     "In the former case my supposition — my judgement with regard to certain conditions — is a merely accidental belief; in the latter it is a necessary belief."
     "It is only by means of the permanent that existence in different parts of the successive series of time receives a quantity, which we entitle duration."
     "Now we know nothing more than that the state of rest was actual in the time that followed the state of motion; consequently, that it was also possible."
     "Now, this is a supposition which, if regarded as of a constitutive character, goes much farther than any experience or observation of ours can justify."
     "That is, it must be possible to reason conversely, and say: The thing, to which the conception of the highest reality belongs, is absolutely necessary."
     "The first is the conjunction of a particular state with another preceding it in the world of sense, the former following the latter by virtue of a law."
     "These two conceptions lie at the foundation of all other reflection, so inseparably are they connected with every mode of exercising the understanding."
     "This synthesis can be divided into those of aggregation and coalition, the former of which is applied to extensive, the latter to intensive quantities."
     "We look upon this connection, in the light of the above-mentioned idea, as if it drew its origin from the supposed being which corresponds to the idea."
     "At the same time, any one desirous of ignoring, in mere speculation, these dogmatical propositions, need not for that reason be accused of denying them."
     "But we ought to reflect that there is nothing, in the world more fatal to the maintenance of a good cause than deceit, misrepresentation, and falsehood."
     "For this reason no given action can have an absolute and spontaneous origination, all actions being phenomena, and belonging to the world of experience."
     "I have, moreover, to apologize for the Latin terms which have been employed, instead of their German synonyms, contrary to the rules of correct writing."
     "As figurative, it is distinguished from the merely intellectual synthesis, which is produced by the understanding alone, without the aid of imagination."
     "But this sceptical method is essentially peculiar to transcendental philosophy, and can perhaps be dispensed with in every other field of investigation."
     "Every composite substance in the world consists of simple parts; and there exists nothing that is not either itself simple, or composed of simple parts."
     "For, in the first place, we can only represent to ourselves one space, and, when we talk of divers spaces, we mean only parts of one and the same space."
     "If the faculty of self-consciousness is to apprehend what lies in the mind, it must all act that and can in this way alone produce an intuition of self."
     "Let me be allowed to term the position which we assign to a conception either in the sensibility or in the pure understanding, the transcendental place."
     "Man is a phenomenon of the sensuous world and, at the same time, therefore, a natural cause, the causality of which must be regulated by empirical laws."
     "Such a belief, contingent indeed, but still forming the ground of the actual use of means for the attainment of certain ends, I term Pragmatical belief."
     "The person who believes in a transcendental theology alone, is termed a deist; he who acknowledges the possibility of a natural theology also, a theist."
     "The solution of these problems is our task in transcendental dialectic, which we are about to expose even at its source, that lies deep in human reason."
     "These terms are regarded as expressions of different and distinguishable notions, although the ground of the distinction has never been clearly exposed."
     "They are nothing but mere forms of thought, which contain only the logical faculty of uniting à priori in consciousness the manifold given in intuition."
     "What may be the nature of objects considered as things in themselves and without reference to the receptivity of our sensibility is quite unknown to us."
     "After long labour he may be able to guard against the error, but he can never be thoroughly rid of the illusion which continually mocks and misleads him."
     "But this is a quite impracticable procedure, as it surpasses all our powers to discover all the possible inferences that can be drawn from a proposition."
     "By virtue of this commercium, phenomena, in so far as they are apart from, and nevertheless in connection with each other, constitute a compositum reale."
     "For of the former alone does she stand in need, in order to preposit the whole series of conditions, and thus present them to the understanding à priori."
     "In the present work, I look for the patient hearing and the impartiality of a /judge;/ in the other, for the good-will and assistance of a /co-labourer/."
     "It merely presents us with the conception of spontaneity of action, as the proper ground for imputing freedom to the cause of a certain class of objects."
     "Now, if the latter is impossible, the former, as an attempt to determine itself by means of the categories as a thinking being in general, is no less so."
     "The apagogic mode of proof is the true source of those illusions which have always had so strong an attraction for the admirers of dogmatical philosophy."
     "The difficulty here lies wholly in the question: How can the subject have an internal intuition of itself? But this difficulty is common to every theory."
     "The necessity is subjectively, but still only comparatively, sufficient, if I am acquainted with no other conditions under which the end can be attained."
     "The principles of such a hypothesis might conduce to the satisfaction of reason, but it would not assist the understanding in its application to objects."
     "The true (transcendental) conception of infinity is: that the successive synthesis of unity in the measurement of a given quantum can never be completed."
     "The usual test, whether that which any one maintains is merely his persuasion, or his subjective conviction at least, that is, his firm belief, is a bet."
     "There is, therefore, contained in the world, something that is absolutely necessary — whether it be the whole cosmical series itself, or only a part of it."
     "This unity may hence be called the rational unity of phenomena, as the other, which the category expresses, may be termed the unity of the understanding."
     "To the number of modes of relation which the understanding cogitates by means of the categories, the number of pure rational conceptions will correspond."
     "Transcendental logic, limited as it is to a determinate content, that of pure à priori cognitions, to wit, cannot imitate general logic in this division."
     "And, as philosophy is a cognition of reason by the aid of conceptions alone, there is to be found in it no principle which deserves to be called an axiom."
     "But there is only a single conception of a thing possible, which completely determines the thing à priori: that is, the conception of the ens realissimum."
     "But, in so far as it exercises an influence upon the action of the understanding and determines it to judgement, sensibility is itself the cause of error."
     "For if experience did not teach you that it was real, you never could conceive à priori the possibility of this ceaseless sequence of being and non-being."
     "For we can infer the particular from the general, only in so far as general properties of things constitute the foundation upon which the particular rest."
     "For, in the latter case, it would come later than the system; whereas it is really itself the parent of all that is systematic in our cognition of nature."
     "A great part, perhaps the greatest part, of the business of our reason consists in the analysation of the conceptions which we already possess of objects."
     "Before objects, are given to me, that is, /à priori/, I must presuppose in myself laws of the understanding which are expressed in conceptions /à priori/."
     "Every colour — for example, red — has a degree, which, be it ever so small, is never the smallest, and so is it always with heat, the momentum of weight, etc."
     "From this investigation it will be found that there are two pure forms of sensuous intuition, as principles of knowledge à priori, namely, space and time."
     "It does not require these ideas for the construction of a science of nature, but, on the contrary, for the purpose of passing beyond the sphere of nature."
     "Now hereby is not represented an object, for by means of this succession, which is common to all apprehension, no one thing is distinguished from another."
     "Particular laws, inasmuch as they concern empirically determined phenomena, cannot be entirely deduced from pure laws, although they all stand under them."
     "Such a dispute serves merely to disclose the antinomy of reason, which, as it has its source in the nature of reason, ought to be thoroughly investigated."
     "The postulate of the possibility of things requires also, that the conception of the things agree with the formal conditions of our experience in general."
     "The unity of reason is therefore not the unity of a possible experience, but is essentially different from this unity, which is that of the understanding."
     "These criteria, however, apply solely to the form of truth, that is, of thought in general, and in so far they are perfectly accurate, yet not sufficient."
     "These highest aims must, from the nature of reason, possess complete unity; otherwise the highest interest of humanity could not be successfully promoted."
     "They are purely speculative questions; and all we have to do, in the practical sphere, is to inquire into the rule of conduct which reason has to present."
     "A direct synthetical proposition, based on conceptions, is a dogma; a proposition of the same kind, based on the construction of conceptions, is a mathema."
     "Change proves merely empirical contingency, that is to say, that the new state could not have existed without a cause, which belongs to the preceding time."
     "His omnipotence cannot be denied, if the existence of a Deity is posited — the existence, that is, of an infinite being, the two conceptions being identical."
     "But the pure conceptions of the understanding would entirely lose all their peculiar character, if we treated them merely as the productions of experience."
     "Consequently, numerical quantities, and with them the determination of a phenomenon as a quantity, can be employed in the one case as well as in the other."
     "In like manner, the second state, as reality (in the phenomenon), differs from the first, in which the reality of the second did not exist, as b from zero."
     "In this manner the paralogism has its foundation in the nature of human reason, and is the parent of an unavoidable, though not insoluble, mental illusion."
     "It follows that these principles can have nothing else for their aim than the conditions of the empirical cognition in the unity of synthesis of phenomena."
     "Many physical powers, which evidence their existence by their effects, are perfectly inscrutable in their nature; they elude all our powers of observation."
     "Negative judgements — those which are so not merely as regards their logical form, but in respect of their content — are not commonly held in especial respect."
     "Now the existence of a given condition presupposes a complete series of conditions up to the absolutely unconditioned, which alone is absolutely necessary."
     "Of the Equivocal Nature or Amphiboly of the Conceptions of Reflection from the Confusion of the Transcendental with the Empirical use of the Understanding."
     "On the contrary, if we ascribe objective reality to these forms of representation, it becomes impossible to avoid changing everything into mere appearance."
     "On the contrary, the number seven is possible only in one manner, and so is likewise the number twelve, which results from the synthesis of seven and five."
     "The apagogic method of proof is admissible only in those sciences where it is impossible to mistake a subjective representation for an objective cognition."
     "The conceptions of the understanding make us acquainted, among many other kinds of unity, with that of the causality of a substance, which is termed power."
     "The first tells us what we have to do, if we wish to become possessed of happiness; the second dictates how we ought to act, in order to deserve happiness."
     "To this highest standpoint I am conducted by the law of homogeneity, as to all lower and more variously-determined conceptions by the law of specification."
     "A clear explanation of the dialectic which lies in our conception, will very soon enable us to come to a satisfactory decision in regard to such a question."
     "And this is the natural course of every human reason, even of the most uneducated, although the path at first entered it does not always continue to follow."
     "Against the assertion of the infinite subdivisibility of matter whose ground of proof is purely mathematical, objections have been alleged by the Monadists."
     "But to reduce this synthesis to conceptions is a function of the understanding, by means of which we attain to cognition, in the proper meaning of the term."
     "Consequently, the categories, without schemata are merely functions of the understanding for the production of conceptions, but do not represent any object."
     "For example, a man who is young cannot at the same time be old; but the same man can very well be at one time young, and at another not young, that is, old."
     "In this sense absolutely possible would signify that which is possible in itself (interne) — which is, in fact, the least that one can predicate of an object."
     "It follows that an infinite series already elapsed is impossible and that, consequently, a beginning of the world is a necessary condition of its existence."
     "Permanence is, in fact, just another expression for time, as the abiding correlate of all existence of phenomena, and of all change, and of all coexistence."
     "Philosophical cognition is the cognition of reason by means of conceptions; mathematical cognition is cognition by means of the construction of conceptions."
     "The latter we cannot cognize; we can only indicate it by means of phenomena, which enable us to have an immediate cognition only of the empirical character."
     "The object of the hypothetical employment of reason is therefore the systematic unity of cognitions; and this unity is the criterion of the truth of a rule."
     "This cause, as the highest member in the series of the causes of cosmical changes, must originate or begin the existence of the latter and their series."
     "This internal phenomenon cannot be admitted to be a self-subsisting thing; for its condition is time, and time cannot be the condition of a thing in itself."
     "We never can imagine or make a representation to ourselves of the non-existence of space, though we may easily enough think that no objects are found in it."
     "At the same time, pure as this conception is from empirical content (impressions of the senses), it enables us to distinguish two different kinds of objects."
     "Be the object what it may, purely sensuous — as pleasure, or presented by pure reason — as good, reason will not yield to grounds which have an empirical origin."
     "But in reckoning my wealth there may be said to be more in a hundred real dollars than in a hundred possible dollars — that is, in the mere conception of them."
     "But this, again, they could not do, did they not reside in a necessary being, as the Supreme Good, which alone can render such a teleological unity possible."
     "However, the internal necessity perpetually to be, is inseparably connected with the necessity always to have been, and so the expression may stand as it is."
     "If it gave us any information in respect to the former statement, it would be a constitutive principle — a principle impossible from the nature of pure reason."
     "Accordingly, when we know in experience that something happens, we always presuppose that something precedes, whereupon it follows in conformity with a rule."
     "But, with the exception of space, there is no representation, subjective and referring to something external to us, which could be called objective à priori."
     "Categories are conceptions which prescribe laws à priori to phenomena, consequently to nature as the complex of all phenomena (natura materialiter spectata)."
     "Consequently, general logic treats of the form of the understanding only, which can be applied to representations, from whatever source they may have arisen."
     "For as existence does not admit of being constructed, it is clear that they must only concern the relations of existence and be merely regulative principles."
     "It follows that this must hold good of all things that are in the different parts of space at the same time, however similar and equal one may be to another."
     "Nevertheless, if the subject is regarded externally, as an object of intuition, it must, in its character of phenomenon, possess the property of composition."
     "Now all experience contains, besides the intuition of the senses through which an object is given, a conception also of an object that is given in intuition."
     "Now all this would be perfectly correct, if the conception of a thing were the only necessary condition of the presentation of objects of external intuition."
     "Now this again presupposes, in conformity with the law of nature, a previous condition and its causality, and this another anterior to the former, and so on."
     "Our nature is so constituted that intuition with us never can be other than sensuous, that is, it contains only the mode in which we are affected by objects."
     "Such a dogmatist promises to extend human knowledge beyond the limits of possible experience; while I humbly confess that this is completely beyond my power."
     "The division is contained only in the progressing decomposition — in the regress itself, which is the condition of the possibility and actuality of the series."
     "The synthesis of our representations rests upon the imagination; their synthetical unity (which is requisite to a judgement), upon the unity of apperception."
     "The understanding, therefore, does by no means find in the internal sense any such synthesis of the manifold, but produces it, in that it affects this sense."
     "These belong to pure intuition, which exists à priori in the mind, as a mere form of sensibility, and without any real object of the senses or any sensation."
     "Thus conducted, this argument is incapable of giving us the least notion of the properties of a necessary being, and must be in every respect without result."
     "We are in no want of words to denominate adequately every mode of representation, without the necessity of encroaching upon terms which are proper to others."
     "We cannot think any object except by means of the categories; we cannot cognize any thought except by means of intuitions corresponding to these conceptions."
     "A perception which relates solely to the subject as a modification of its state, is a sensation (sensatio), an objective perception is a cognition (cognitio)."
     "And yet we can find no more certain ground on which to base the discussion of the question whether the sphere of possibility is wider than that of experience."
     "For truth or illusory appearance does not reside in the object, in so far as it is intuited, but in the judgement upon the object, in so far as it is thought."
     "If we keep to what is contained in the conception, the judgement is merely analytical — it is merely an explanation of what we have cogitated in the conception."
     "Hence it happens that, admitting a divine being, I can have no conception of the internal possibility of its perfection, or of the necessity of its existence."
     "Hume was probably aware, although he never clearly developed the notion, that we proceed in judgements of a certain class beyond our conception if the object."
     "The first denotes the mathematical total of all phenomena and the totality of their synthesis — in its progress by means of composition, as well as by division."
     "The former appertain absolutely and necessarily to our sensibility, of whatsoever kind our sensations may be; the latter may be of very diversified character."
     "The merely transcendental use of the categories is therefore, in fact, no use at all and has no determined, or even, as regards its form, determinable object."
     "The paths of comets exhibit still greater variations, for, so far as our observation extends, they do not return upon their own course in a circle or ellipse."
     "The very same is the case with the other categories; for example, how a thing can be of the same sort with many others, that is, can be a quantity, and so on."
     "There is no possibility of evading the conclusion — you find yourselves compelled to declare: There are certain subjects which cannot be annihilated in thought."
     "This attempt is, indeed, inconsistent with the grand aim of complete systematic unity in the sphere of cognition — a unity to which no bounds are set by reason."
     "This conception of causality leads us to the conception of action; that of action, to the conception of force; and through it, to the conception of substance."
     "Through the first an object is given to us; through the second, it is, in relation to the representation (which is a mere determination of the mind), thought."
     "We are therefore not justified in saying that all reality is in perfect agreement and harmony, because no contradiction is discoverable among its conceptions."
     "And even if we should suppose a different kind of intuition from our own, still our functions of thought would have no use or signification in respect thereof."
     "And it must always be regarded in this manner, if we wish to know whether there is or is not contained in it a manifold whose parts are external to each other."
     "But this is merely subjective, and does not determine an object, and consequently cannot be held to be cognition of an object — not even in the phenomenal world."
     "Cicero says that this mode of reasoning has received this appellation, because, if followed, it puts an end to the employment of reason in the affairs of life."
     "Difference of place without any other conditions, makes the plurality and distinction of objects as phenomena, not only possible in itself, but even necessary."
     "Every action, in so far as it is productive of an event, is itself an event or occurrence, and presupposes another preceding state, in which its cause existed."
     "Failing this condition of judgement (schema), subsumption is impossible; for there is in such a case nothing given, which may be subsumed under the conception."
     "But if I take away all intuition, there still remains the form of thought, that is, the mode of determining an object for the manifold of a possible intuition."
     "For when this question is fully decided, it can reach its aim with perfect ease, the determination, to wit, of the extent and limits of the pure understanding."
     "Indeed, the logical clearness of this representation of a rule, determining the series of events, is possible only when we have made use thereof in experience."
     "It is evident from the remarks that have been made in the preceding sections, that an answer to this question will be far from being difficult or unconvincing."
     "That is the answer to the first of the two questions of pure reason which relate to its practical interest: Do that which will render thee worthy of happiness."
     "That the actions of man will never be in perfect accordance with all the requirements of the pure ideas of reason, does not prove the thought to be chimerical."
     "The mathematical conception of a triangle I should construct, that is, present à priori in intuition, and in this way attain to rational-synthetical cognition."
     "The transcendental idea of freedom is far from constituting the entire content of the psychological conception so termed, which is for the most part empirical."
     "They contain merely the rule, by which we are to seek in the world of perception or experience the synthetical unity of that which cannot be intuited à priori."
     "This remark may be serviceable as a warning against concluding, from the possibility of a conception — which is logical — the possibility of a thing — which is real."
     "Where action (consequently activity and force) exists, substance also must exist, and in it alone must be sought the seat of that fruitful source of phenomena."
     "But a third step is necessary — indicative of the maturity and manhood of the judgement, which now lays a firm foundation upon universal and necessary principles."
     "But if, in addition to the fundamental cognition, a second judgement is necessary for the production of the conclusion, it is called a conclusion of the reason."
     "Failing this latter, it has no sense, and utterly void of content, although it may contain the logical function for constructing a conception from certain data."
     "In this case it must also begin to act, and its causality would therefore belong to time, and consequently to the sum total of phenomena, that is, to the world."
     "Phenomena would nevertheless continue to present objects to our intuition; for mere intuition does not in any respect stand in need of the functions of thought."
     "The ideas of pure reason cannot be, of themselves and in their own nature, dialectical; it is from their misemployment alone that fallacies and illusions arise."
     "The objects of experience then are not things in themselves, but are given only in experience, and have no existence apart from and independently of experience."
     "There is nothing actually given — we can be conscious of nothing as real, except a perception and the empirical progression from it to other possible perceptions."
     "We have made these observations for the purpose of guarding against misunderstanding, to which the doctrine of our intuition of self as a phenomenon is exposed."
     "A will is purely animal (arbitrium brutum) when it is determined by sensuous impulses or instincts only, that is, when it is determined in a pathological manner."
     "All this is best effected, nay, cannot be effected otherwise than by means of such a schema, which requires us to regard this ideal thing as an actual existence."
     "And finally I determine my cognition by means of the predicate of the rule (this is the conclusio), consequently, I determine it à priori by means of the reason."
     "At this stage of our inquiry it is my duty to give an explanation of this, the highest faculty of cognition, and I confess I find myself here in some difficulty."
     "But if I suppress both subject and predicate in thought, no contradiction arises; for there is nothing at all, and therefore no means of forming a contradiction."
     "But the order of succession in imagination is not determined, and the series of successive representations may be taken retrogressively as well as progressively."
     "I shall merely enumerate these, leaving it to the reader, who must by this time be well practised in such matters, to investigate the fallacies residing therein."
     "An extensive quantity I call that wherein the representation of the parts renders possible (and therefore necessarily antecedes) the representation of the whole."
     "But this principle of pure reason is evidently synthetical; for, analytically, the conditioned certainly relates to some condition, but not to the unconditioned."
     "For, that bodies are heavy, and, consequently, that they fall when their supports are taken away, must have been known to him previously, by means of experience."
     "General logic abstracts all content of the predicate (though it be negative), and only considers whether the said predicate be affirmed or denied of the subject."
     "If, on the other hand, the object conforms to the nature of our faculty of intuition, I can then easily conceive the possibility of such an /à priori/ knowledge."
     "In the first of these three classes, we consider only two conceptions; in the second, two judgements; in the third, several judgements in relation to each other."
     "In this way, its necessity does not require, nor does it even permit, the presence of an empirical condition: and it is, consequently, unconditionally necessary."
     "It therefore has subjective reality, in reference to our internal experience, that is, I have really the representation of time and of my determinations therein."
     "Now that quantity which is apprehended only as unity, and in which plurality can be represented only by approximation to negation = O, I term intensive quantity."
     "Spectators, observing that each party is alternately conqueror and conquered, are led to regard the subject of dispute as beyond the power of man to decide upon."
     "The infinity of time signifies nothing more than that every determined quantity of time is possible only through limitations of one time lying at the foundation."
     "The judgements of moral according to in its purity and ultimate results are framed according ideas; the observance of its laws, according to according to maxims."
     "The mere form of intuition, without substance, is in itself no object, but the merely formal condition of an object (as phenomenon), as pure space and pure time."
     "The second error which arises from the misconception of the principle of systematic unity is that of perverted reason (perversa ratio, usteron roteron rationis)."
     "The unity of this apperception I call the transcendental unity of self-consciousness, in order to indicate the possibility of à priori cognition arising from it."
     "These, however adorned, and hid under whatever embellishments of rhetoric and sentiment, are at bottom identical with the arguments we are at present to discuss."
     "This interchange becomes evident when I regard this supreme being, which, relatively to the world, was absolutely (unconditionally) necessary, as a thing per se."
     "Thus, for example, out of 200,000 illuminations by the moon, I might compose and give à priori, that is construct, the degree of our sensations of the sun-light."
     "Thus, the distinction of the transcendental and empirical belongs only to the critique of cognitions, and does not concern the relation of these to their object."
     "To the categories of quantity, that is, the conceptions of all, many, and one, the conception which annihilates all, that is, the conception of none, is opposed."
     "And thus nature and freedom, each in the complete and absolute signification of these terms, can exist, without contradiction or disagreement, in the same action."
     "But if all that we perceive must be regarded as conditionally necessary, it is impossible that anything which is empirically given should be absolutely necessary."
     "But the process has not been ended by convincing them that one or both were in the wrong and had maintained an assertion which was without valid grounds of proof."
     "For there is nothing absolutely connecting reason with such an existence; on the contrary, it can annihilate it in thought, always and without self-contradiction."
     "All phenomena exist in time, wherein alone as substratum, that is, as the permanent form of the internal intuition, coexistence and succession can be represented."
     "For neither absolute nor relative determinations of objects can be intuited prior to the existence of the things to which they belong, and therefore not à priori."
     "It follows that we regard reason, in spite of the empirical conditions of the act, as completely free, and therefore, therefore, as in the present case, culpable."
     "The schema of the triangle can exist nowhere else than in thought, and it indicates a rule of the synthesis of the imagination in regard to pure figures in space."
     "This use of the understanding excludes all empirical elements; and we cannot, as has been shown above, have any favourable conception beforehand of its procedure."
     "We find that reason perpetually comes to a stand, when it attempts to gain /à priori/ the perception even of those laws which the most common experience confirms."
     "We find that the attempt to make the slightest alteration, in any part, leads inevitably to contradictions, not merely in this system, but in human reason itself."
     "As we called the pure conceptions of the understanding categories, we shall also distinguish those of pure reason by a new name and call them transcendental ideas."
     "Even poisons are serviceable; they destroy the evil effects of other poisons generated in our system, and must always find a place in every complete pharmacopoeia."
     "And thus we must ascribe intensive quantity, that is, a degree of influence on sense to all objects of perception, in so far as this perception contains sensation."
     "But every transcendental proposition sets out from a conception, and posits the synthetical condition of the possibility of an object according to this conception."
     "But something more is required before I can attribute to such a conception objective validity, that is real possibility — the other possibility being merely logical."
     "But they are nothing but phenomena; a complete knowledge of which — a knowledge to which all principles à priori must at last relate — is the only possible experience."
     "For this conception of an infinite given quantity is empirical; but we cannot apply the conception of an infinite quantity to the world as an object of the senses."
     "Necessity and strict universality, therefore, are infallible tests for distinguishing pure from empirical knowledge, and are inseparably connected with each other."
     "Proceeding in this way, through a chain of inferences, and always on the ground of intuition, he arrives at a clear and universally valid solution of the question."
     "The light dove cleaving in free flight the thin air, whose resistance it feels, might imagine that her movements would be far more free and rapid in airless space."
     "The relations, therefore, which the major proposition, as the rule, represents between a cognition and its condition, constitute the different kinds of syllogisms."
     "This existence is purely ideal, and not objective; it is the mere expression of the systematic unity which is to be the guide of reason in the field of experience."
     "Transcendental hypotheses are therefore inadmissible; and we cannot use the liberty of employing, in the absence of physical, hyperphysical grounds of explanation."
     "Transcendental idealism allows that the objects of external intuition — as intuited in space, and all changes in time — as represented by the internal sense, are real."
     "We infer, from the order and design visible in the universe, as a disposition of a thoroughly contingent character, the existence of a cause proportionate thereto."
     "We shall now proceed to fulfil this duty, and thereby throw not a little light on the question as to the determination of the proper business of the understanding."
     "Before proceeding to expose the fallacy in this dialectical argument, it will be necessary to have a correct understanding of certain conceptions that appear in it."
     "If we wish to prove the contingency of matter, we must have recourse to a transcendental argument, which the physico-theological was constructed expressly to avoid."
     "By the polemic of pure reason I mean the defence of its propositions made by reason, in opposition to the dogmatical counter-propositions advanced by other parties."
     "For it can give no answer to our question respecting the conditions of its synthesis — except such as must be supplemented by another question, and so on to infinity."
     "That is to say, the movements of those planets which do not form a circle will approximate more or less to the properties of a circle, and probably form an ellipse."
     "The table of the categories is naturally our guide to the table of principles, because these are nothing else than rules for the objective employment of the former."
     "The whole of this part of transcendental logic consists of two books, of which the one contains the conceptions, and the other the principles of pure understanding."
     "These conceptions we shall, with Aristotle, call categories, our purpose being originally identical with his, notwithstanding the great difference in the execution."
     "This is plain from our use of the term of relation is in judgements, in order to distinguish the objective unity of given representations from the subjective unity."
     "To call a phenomenon a real thing prior to perception means either that we must meet with this phenomenon in the progress of experience, or it means nothing at all."
     "We are actually in possession of à priori synthetical cognitions, as is proved by the existence of the principles of the understanding, which anticipate experience."
     "We demonstrate from indubitable principles, not merely our ignorance in respect to this or that subject, but in regard to all possible questions of a certain class."
     "Whatever contradicts these rules is false, because thereby the understanding is made to contradict its own universal laws of thought; that is, to contradict itself."
     "But, although in such cases they have a common object, the mode in which reason considers that object is very different in philosophy from what it is in mathematics."
     "But if we consider these principles of the pure understanding in relation to their origin, we shall find them to be anything rather than cognitions from conceptions."
     "Destitute, however, of any guiding principle, he picked them up just as they occurred to him, and at first hunted out ten, which he called categories (predicaments)."
     "For the same reason, his view of the possible community of substances could not represent it but as a predetermined harmony, and by no means as a physical influence."
     "In general logic, therefore, that part which constitutes pure logic must be carefully distinguished from that which constitutes applied (though still general) logic."
     "In neither case — the regressus in infinitum, nor the regressus in indefinitum, is the series of conditions to be considered as actually infinite in the object itself."
     "In the same way, Transcendental Analytic was seen to be a canon of the pure understanding; for it alone is competent to enounce true à priori synthetical cognitions."
     "It follows that the perception of this permanent existence is possible only through a thing without me and not through the mere representation of a thing without me."
     "It is, however, the true stumbling-stone to philosophy, which meets with unconquerable difficulties in the way of its admitting this kind of unconditioned causality."
     "Now there are objects which reason /thinks/, and that necessarily, but which cannot be given in experience, or, at least, cannot be given /so/ as reason thinks them."
     "So much the wider field, it may appear, lies open to hypothesis; as, where we cannot know with certainty, we are at liberty to make guesses and to form suppositions."
     "Such is the constitution of the ideal of reason, which is always based upon determinate conceptions, and serves as a rule and a model for limitation or of criticism."
     "Such objects are consequently nothing more than the transference of this consciousness of mine to other things which can only thus be represented as thinking beings."
     "That is to say, substances must stand (mediately or immediately) in dynamical community with each other, if coexistence is to be cognized in any possible experience."
     "They are conceptions of an object in general, by means of which its intuition is contemplated as determined in relation to one of the logical functions of judgement."
     "We come now to /metaphysics/, a purely speculative science, which occupies a completely isolated position and is entirely independent of the teachings of experience."
     "When the question relates merely to that which is, not to that which ought to be, the conditioned which is presented in experience is always cogitated as contingent."
     "A will is sensuous, in so far as it is pathologically affected (by sensuous impulses); it is termed animal (arbitrium brutum), when it is pathologically necessitated."
     "Both proofs originate fairly from the nature of the case, and the advantage presented by the mistakes of the dogmatists of both parties has been completely set aside."
     "But empiricism, in compensation, holds out to reason, in its speculative interests, certain important advantages, far exceeding any that the dogmatist can promise us."
     "But its possibility does not rest on the following series o, p, q, r, which for this reason cannot be regarded as given, but only as capable of being given (dabilis)."
     "For example, a body is in a state of rest after motion, but we cannot infer the contingency of the motion from the fact that the former is the opposite of the latter."
     "For the only arena for such a struggle would be upon the field of pure theology and psychology; but on this ground there can appear no combatant whom we need to fear."
     "A new light must have flashed on the mind of the first man (/Thales/, or whatever may have been his name) who demonstrated the properties of the /isosceles/ triangle."
     "In order to construct the table of ideas in correspondence with the table of categories, we take first the two primitive quanta of all our intuitions, time and space."
     "In this case, time is altogether left out in the connection of the conditioned with the condition; they are supposed to be given in themselves, and contemporaneously."
     "In this view, it is superior to all other conceptions, which, as deficient and incomplete, do not possess the characteristic of independence of all higher conditions."
     "In this way alone can I be authorized to say of the phenomenon itself, and not merely of my own apprehension, that a certain order or sequence is to be found therein."
     "Nevertheless, this principle of the anticipation of perception must somewhat startle an inquirer whom initiation into transcendental philosophy has rendered cautious."
     "Of this representation I can make nothing, inasmuch as it does not indicate to me what determinations the thing possesses which must thus be valid as premier subject."
     "The absolutely internal in matter, and as it should be according to the pure understanding, is a mere chimera, for matter is not an object for the pure understanding."
     "The causality of reason in its intelligible character does not begin to be; it does not make its appearance at a certain time, for the purpose of producing an effect."
     "We are not, however, confined to theoretical sources of cognition for the means of satisfying this additional requirement, but may derive them from practical sources."
     "We find it compelled to retrace its steps in innumerable instances, and to abandon the path on which it had entered, because this does not lead to the desired result."
     "But we discover variations from this course, and we proceed to suppose that the planets revolve in a path which, if not a circle, is of a character very similar to it."
     "But, as we have no source of cognition besides these two, it follows that error is caused solely by the unobserved influence of the sensibility upon the understanding."
     "If we are only conscious that there is a difference, but are not conscious of the difference — that is, what the difference is — the representation must be termed obscure."
     "But things in space and time are given only in so far as they are perceptions (representations accompanied with sensation), therefore only by empirical representation."
     "By the conceptions, therefore, of unity, truth, and perfection, we have made no addition to the transcendental table of the categories, which is complete without them."
     "In cognition there are two elements: firstly, the conception, whereby an object is cogitated (the category); and, secondly, the intuition, whereby the object is given."
     "In regard to the third motive for the preliminary choice of a party in this war of assertions, it seems very extraordinary that empiricism should be utterly unpopular."
     "In the earliest times of which history affords us any record, /mathematics/ had already entered on the sure course of science, among that wonderful nation, the Greeks."
     "Let it be allowed me to call these pure, but deduced conceptions of the understanding, the predicables of the pure understanding, in contradistinction to predicaments."
     "Now as these conceptions always possess the character of necessity, experience is possible only by means of a representation of the necessary connection of perception."
     "On the contrary, the empirical synthesis and the series of conditions in the phenomenal world — subsumed in the minor — are necessarily successive and given in time alone."
     "Such an existence would be purely fictitious, and the hypostatizing of the content of the idea into an ideal, as an individual being, is a step perfectly unauthorized."
     "The conception of quantity cannot be explained except by saying that it is the determination of a thing whereby it can be cogitated how many times one is placed in it."
     "The question therefore is whether, over and above the empirical use of the understanding, a transcendental use is possible, which applies to the noumenon as an object."
     "The series of conditions is discoverable only in the regressive synthesis itself, and not in the phenomenon considered as a thing in itself — given prior to all regress."
     "They are not mere fictions, but natural and necessary products of reason, and have hence a necessary relation to the whole sphere of the exercise of the understanding."
     "This might be true of things in themselves, but it cannot be asserted of phenomena, which, as conditions of each other, are only given in the empirical regress itself."
     "Thus God and a future life are two hypotheses which, according to the principles of pure reason, are inseparable from the obligation which this reason imposes upon us."
     "We shall divide it into two parts, the first of which will treat of the transcendent conceptions of pure reason, the second of transcendent and dialectical syllogisms."
     "We should be loth to undertake this labour, because the discoveries we might make would not be of the smallest use in the sphere of concrete or physical investigation."
     "For the world is a sum of phenomena; there must, therefore, be some transcendental basis of these phenomena, that is, a basis cogitable by the pure understanding alone."
     "And as in every number we must have unity as the foundation, so a phenomenon taken as unity is a quantity, and as such always a continuous quantity (quantum continuum)."
     "And nature (considered merely as nature in general) is dependent on them, as the original ground of her necessary conformability to law (as natura formaliter spectata)."
     "But we cannot affirm the converse, that space, as something self-subsistent, can determine real things in regard to size or shape, for it is in itself not a real thing."
     "Empirical intuition is possible only through pure intuition (of space and time); consequently, what geometry affirms of the latter, is indisputably valid of the former."
     "Finally, as regards the third postulate, it applies to material necessity in existence, and not to merely formal and logical necessity in the connection of conceptions."
     "For the empirical consciousness which accompanies different representations is in itself fragmentary and disunited, and without relation to the identity of the subject."
     "General logic is called applied, when it is directed to the laws of the use of the understanding, under the subjective empirical conditions which psychology teaches us."
     "Hence, in the conclusion of a syllogism we restrict a predicate to a certain object, after having thought it in the major in its whole extent under a certain condition."
     "In algebra, a certain method of notation by signs is adopted, and these indicate the different possible constructions of quantities, the extraction of roots, and so on."
     "In the cultivation of a talent, which has given evidence of an impulse towards self-development, discipline takes a negative, culture and doctrine a positive, part."
     "It is only by criticism that metaphysicians (and, as such, theologians too) can be saved from these controversies and from the consequent perversion of their doctrines."
     "Now we are required by a logical maxim to reduce these differences to as small a number as possible, by comparing them and discovering the hidden identity which exists."
     "Still less let the reader here expect a critique of books and systems of pure reason; our present object is exclusively a critique of the faculty of pure reason itself."
     "That is to say, it is not limited by, but rather limits, sensibility, by giving the name of noumena to things, not considered as phenomena, but as things in themselves."
     "The idea is merely to be adopted as a point of view, from which this unity, so essential to reason and so beneficial to the understanding, may be regarded as radiating."
     "The principle that everything which happens (the empirically contingent) must have a cause, is a principle of the cognition of nature, but not of speculative cognition."
     "There are neither more, nor can there be less, than this number, because there are no other series of synthetical hypotheses, limiting à priori the empirical synthesis."
     "There is no other course left open to her than to reflect with herself upon the origin of this disunion in reason — whether it may not arise from a mere misunderstanding."
     "These appellations I have chosen advisedly, in order that we might not lose sight of the distinctions in respect of the evidence and the employment of these principles."
     "This knowledge of nature again reacts upon this idea — its cause; and thus our belief in a divine author of the universe rises to the power of an irresistible conviction."
     "This we might call the qualitative plurality of characteristic marks, which belong to a conception as to a common foundation, but are not cogitated as a quantity in it."
     "Fight as vigorously as they may, the shadows which they hew down, immediately start up again, like the heroes in Walhalla, and renew the bloodless and unceasing contest."
     "For this reason, every transition in perception to anything which follows upon another in time, is a determination of time by means of the production of this perception."
     "It begins with principles, which cannot be dispensed with in the field of experience, and the truth and sufficiency of which are, at the same time, insured by experience."
     "If it is shown to be insufficient, speculative reason cannot present us with any satisfactory proof of the existence of a being corresponding to our transcendental idea."
     "As regards the /form/, there are two indispensable conditions, which any one who undertakes so difficult a task as that of a critique of pure reason, is bound to fulfil."
     "By a transcendental exposition, I mean the explanation of a conception, as a principle, whence can be discerned the possibility of other synthetical à priori cognitions."
     "Every general proposition, even if derived from experience by the process of induction, may serve as the major in a syllogism; but it is not for that reason a principle."
     "Space and time, as conditions of the possibility of the presentation of objects to us, are valid no further than for objects of sense, consequently, only for experience."
     "The conception of such a being is the conception of God in its transcendental sense, and thus the ideal of pure reason is the object-matter of a transcendental theology."
     "The essential difference of these two modes of cognition consists, therefore, in this formal quality; it does not regard the difference of the matter or objects of both."
     "The explanation of the possibility of synthetical judgements is a task with which general logic has nothing to do; indeed she needs not even be acquainted with its name."
     "The form of judgements — converted into a conception of the synthesis of intuitions — produced the categories which direct the employment of the understanding in experience."
     "The logical principle of genera, accordingly, if it is to be applied to nature (by which I mean objects presented to our senses), presupposes a transcendental principle."
     "The whole aim of the transcendental deduction of all à priori conceptions is to show that these conceptions are à priori conditions of the possibility of all experience."
     "Theoretical cognition is speculative when it relates to an object or certain conceptions of an object which is not given and cannot be discovered by means of experience."
     "They are always real, because they concern the existence of substance (negations are only determinations, which express the non-existence of something in the substance)."
     "But as this synthesis must constitute a series that cannot be completed, it is impossible for us to cogitate prior to it, and consequently not by means of it, a totality."
     "For these reasons, the action of a free agent must be termed, in regard to causality, if not in relation to time, an absolutely primal beginning of a series of phenomena."
     "For this foundation has been hitherto insecure from the many subterranean passages which reason in its confident but vain search for treasures has made in all directions."
     "For this purpose, we must prove, that our internal and, to Descartes, indubitable experience is itself possible only under the previous assumption of external experience."
     "For this reason transcendental propositions cannot be framed by means of the construction of conceptions; they are à priori, and based entirely on conceptions themselves."
     "Beyond this region opinion is mere invention; unless we are groping about for the truth on a path not yet fully known, and have some hopes of stumbling upon it by chance."
     "But no one ought, on this account, to overlook the difference of the elements contributed by each; we have rather great reason carefully to separate and distinguish them."
     "It seemed to those philosophers who criticized his mode of discussion that his purpose was to deny completely both of two self-contradictory propositions — which is absurd."
     "Persuasion, accordingly, cannot be subjectively distinguished from conviction, that is, so long as the subject views its judgement simply as a phenomenon of its own mind."
     "To acquire the conception of change, therefore, the perception of some existing object and of the succession of its determinations, in one word, experience, is necessary."
     "We may, at the same time, term the non-sensuous cause of phenomena the transcendental object — but merely as a mental correlate to sensibility, considered as a receptivity."
     "Consequently, many series of things may have a beginning in the world, but the world itself cannot have a beginning, and is, therefore, in relation to past time, infinite."
     "But neither can we admit that there is any proper sceptical employment of pure reason, such as might be based upon the principle of neutrality in all speculative disputes."
     "But the judgements which these pure intuitions enable us to make, never reach farther than to objects of the senses, and are valid only for objects of possible experience."
     "If the judgement is affirmative, I predicate of the conception only that which was already cogitated in it; if negative, I merely exclude from the conception its contrary."
     "In the preceding remarks, we considered the changes in the world of sense as constituting a dynamical series, in which each member is subordinated to another — as its cause."
     "It is evident, therefore, that hypotheses, in the speculative sphere, are valid, not as independent propositions, but only relatively to opposite transcendent assumptions."
     "Now the question arises whether the pure conceptions of our understanding do possess significance in respect of these latter, and may possibly be a mode of cognizing them."
     "Now these sciences, if they can be termed rational at all, must contain elements of /à priori/ cognition, and this cognition may stand in a twofold relation to its object."
     "On this account, this category of substance stands under the title of relation, rather because it is the condition thereof than because it contains in itself any relation."
     "Such a regress is, therefore, the regressus in indefinitum, which, as not determining a quantity in the object, is clearly distinguishable from the regressus in infinitum."
     "Such, for example, is the possibility of the division of a simple substance into several substances; and conversely, of the coalition of several into one simple substance."
     "The proposition therefore — if all causality is possible only in accordance with the laws of nature — is, when stated in this unlimited and general manner, self-contradictory."
     "Thus arose that unfortunate ontological argument, which neither satisfies the healthy common sense of humanity, nor sustains the scientific examination of the philosopher."
     "And so would it really be, if the pure understanding were capable of an immediate application to objects, and if space and time were determinations of things in themselves."
     "Antithetic is not, therefore, occupied with one-sided statements, but is engaged in considering the contradictory nature of the general cognitions of reason and its causes."
     "But to aim at realizing the ideal in an example in the world of experience — to describe, for instance, the character of the perfectly wise man in a romance — is impracticable."
     "But we can very easily conceive the possibility of community (of substances as phenomena) if we represent them to ourselves as in space, consequently in external intuition."
     "For, without such a series, the mental representation of the series of time itself, as the condition of the possibility of the sensuous world, could not be presented to us."
     "Now the transcendental (subjective) reality at least of the pure conceptions of reason rests upon the fact that we are led to such ideas by a necessary procedure of reason."
     "On this account, moreover, it is neither a canon of the understanding in general, nor an organon of a particular science, but merely a cathartic of the human understanding."
     "Phenomenal substance is not an absolute subject; it is merely a permanent sensuous image, and nothing more than an intuition, in which the unconditioned is not to be found."
     "Reason, when employed in the field of experience, does not stand in need of criticism, because its principles are subjected to the continual test of empirical observations."
     "The first will treat of the sensuous condition under which alone pure conceptions of the understanding can be employed — that is, of the schematism of the pure understanding."
     "The proposition above-mentioned does not enounce that three angles necessarily exist, but, upon condition that a triangle exists, three angles must necessarily exist — in it."
     "There are only two possible ways in which synthetical representation and its objects can coincide with and relate necessarily to each other, and, as it were, meet together."
     "They are empirical, when sensation (which presupposes the actual presence of the object) is contained in them; and pure, when no sensation is mixed with the representation."
     "This highest cause, then, we regard as absolutely necessary, because we find it absolutely necessary to rise to it, and do not discover any reason for proceeding beyond it."
     "Thus we find in purely theoretical judgements an analogon of practical judgements, to which the word belief may properly be applied, and which we may term doctrinal belief."
     "We can form an intuition, by means of the mere conception of it, of a cone, without the aid of experience; but the colour of the cone we cannot know except from experience."
     "We employ it in this place in the latter sense — that of a dynamical community, without which even the community of place (communio spatii) could not be empirically cognized."
     "A transcendental negation, on the contrary, indicates non-being in itself, and is opposed to transcendental affirmation, the conception of which of itself expresses a being."
     "If, then, everything happens solely in accordance with the laws of nature, there cannot be any real first beginning of things, but only a subaltern or comparative beginning."
     "But he proceeded with perfect consequence and declared it to be impossible, with such conceptions and the principles arising from them, to overstep the limits of experience."
     "But this circumstance is easily overlooked, because the said intuition can itself be given à priori, and therefore is hardly to be distinguished from a mere pure conception."
     "By means of sensibility, therefore, objects are given to us, and it alone furnishes us with intuitions; by the understanding they are thought, and from it arise conceptions."
     "By nature, in the empirical sense of the word, we understand the totality of phenomena connected, in respect of their existence, according to necessary rules, that is, laws."
     "For if the objects to which those principles must be applied were things in themselves, it would be quite impossible to cognize aught concerning them synthetically à priori."
     "For, however complete the list of /principles/ for this system may be in the Critique, the correctness of the system requires that no /deduced/ conceptions should be absent."
     "In like manner, transcendental æsthetic cannot number the conception of change among its data à priori; for time itself does not change, but only something which is in time."
     "Now a transcendental determination of time is so far homogeneous with the category, which constitutes the unity thereof, that it is universal and rests upon a rule à priori."
     "Now, a sensuous object is completely determined, when it has been compared with all phenomenal predicates, and represented by means of these either positively or negatively."
     "Sensuous intuition is either pure intuition (space and time) or empirical intuition — of that which is immediately represented in space and time by means of sensation as real."
     "This part of our Critique will accomplish, from the transcendental point of view, what has been usually attempted, but miserably executed, under the name of practical logic."
     "Thus it becomes the conception of an individual object, which is completely determined by and through the mere idea, and must consequently be termed an ideal of pure reason."
     "Change is but a mode of existence, which follows on another mode of existence of the same object; hence all that changes is permanent, and only the condition thereof changes."
     "For a reality which should follow upon a void time, in other words, a beginning, which no state of things precedes, can just as little be apprehended as the void time itself."
     "For how can any experience be adequate with an idea? The very essence of an idea consists in the fact that no experience can ever be discovered congruent or adequate with it."
     "If, for example, we presuppose that the world of sense is given in itself in its totality, it is false, either that it is infinite, or that it is finite and limited in space."
     "A dull or narrow-minded person, to whom nothing is wanting but a proper degree of understanding, may be improved by tuition, even so far as to deserve the epithet of learned."
     "I am, therefore, conscious of my identical self, in relation to all the variety of representations given to me in an intuition, because I call all of them my representations."
     "In a judgement one may call the given conceptions logical matter (for the judgement), the relation of these to each other (by means of the copula), the form of the judgement."
     "In such a case, we merely fail to find the additional form of unity we expected, but we do not lose the rational unity which the mind requires in its procedure in experience."
     "In the transcendental sphere of pure reason, then, and in the case of synthetical propositions, it is inadmissible to support a statement by disproving the counter-statement."
     "It follows that your question — your idea — is by no means necessary for the explanation of any phenomenon; and the idea cannot have been in any sense given by the object itself."
     "It may be sufficient in this place to define theoretical knowledge or cognition as knowledge of that which is, and practical knowledge as knowledge of that which ought to be."
     "No doubt it appears as if this were in thorough contradiction to all the notions which people have hitherto entertained in regard to the procedure of the human understanding."
     "On the other hand, the internal determinations of a substantia phaenomenon in space are nothing but relations, and it is itself nothing more than a complex of mere relations."
     "That is to say, our objections not be ontological, but must be directed against the causal connection with a series of phenomena of a condition which is itself unconditioned."
     "The conception of a noumenon is therefore not the conception of an object, but merely a problematical conception inseparably connected with the limitation of our sensibility."
     "The third rule for the guidance of pure reason in the conduct of a proof is that all transcendental proofs must never be apagogic or indirect, but always ostensive or direct."
     "There is nothing, however useful, however sacred it may be, that can claim exemption from the searching examination of this supreme tribunal, which has no respect of persons."
     "These dynamical laws are, however, constitutive in relation to experience, inasmuch as they render the conceptions without which experience could not exist possible à priori."
     "These representations, in so far as they are connected and determinable in this relation (in space and time) according to laws of the unity of experience, are called objects."
     "Transcendental illusion, on the contrary, does not cease to exist, even after it has been exposed, and its nothingness clearly perceived by means of transcendental criticism."
     "We must inquire, for example, whether or not imagination (connected with consciousness), memory, wit, and analysis are not merely different forms of understanding and reason."
     "By the defence of statements of this character, I do not mean an attempt at discovering new grounds for their support, but merely the refutation of the arguments of opponents."
     "For phenomena, as mere representations, are real only in perception; and perception is, in fact, nothing but the reality of an empirical representation, that is, a phenomenon."
     "For they would not even be possible à priori, if we could not rely on the assistance of pure intuition (in mathematics), or on that of the conditions of a possible experience."
     "Hence a judgement of this kind has only private validity — is only valid for the individual who judges, and the holding of a thing to be true in this way cannot be communicated."
     "And yet even these principles themselves, though they derive their validity from pure conceptions, are only admitted in mathematics because they can be presented in intuition."
     "Besides, not being founded on experience, they are not presented with any object in à priori intuition upon which, antecedently to experience, they might base their synthesis."
     "But an empirical proposition cannot possess the qualities of necessity and absolute universality, which, nevertheless, are the characteristics of all geometrical propositions."
     "Hence, when a cognition is contemplated as conditioned, reason is compelled to consider the series of conditions in an ascending line as completed and given in their totality."
     "In other words, it must be perfectly indifferent to you whether you say, when you have discovered this unity: God has wisely willed it so; or: Nature has wisely arranged this."
     "It follows that we must arrange the determinations of the internal sense, as phenomena in time, exactly in the same manner as we arrange those of the external senses in space."
     "It is one and the same spontaneity which at one time, under the name of imagination, at another under that of understanding, produces conjunction in the manifold of intuition."
     "Now it cannot be concluded from the fact that a state opposite to the state A follows it, that the contradictory opposite of A is possible; and that A is therefore contingent."
     "On the contrary, scepticism is merely a means of awakening reason from its dogmatic dreams and exciting it to a more careful investigation into its own powers and pretensions."
     "Our table of the categories suggests considerations of some importance, which may perhaps have significant results in regard to the scientific form of all rational cognitions."
     "Such are the ideals which painters and physiognomists profess to have in their minds, and which can serve neither as a model for production nor as a standard for appreciation."
     "We have seen that everything which the understanding draws from itself, without borrowing from experience, it nevertheless possesses only for the behoof and use of experience."
     "All this proves that the cosmological ideas are nothing but regulative principles, and not constitutive; and that their aim is not to realize an actual totality in such series."
     "But when we set the unconditioned — which is the aim of all our inquiries — in a sphere which lies out of the world of sense and possible experience, our ideas become transcendent."
     "But, as regards space, there exists in it no distinction between progressus and regressus; for it is an aggregate and not a series — its parts existing together at the same time."
     "For the attention of reason, which in abstract speculation does not easily become conscious of its errors, is thus roused to the momenta in the determination of its principles."
     "For this series, being infinite in succession and always incomplete, cannot represent an infinite number of members, and still less a composition of these members into a whole."
     "If we consider inanimate or merely animal nature, we can discover no reason for ascribing to ourselves any other than a faculty which is determined in a purely sensuous manner."
     "If we separate them, we have intuitions without conceptions, or conceptions without intuitions; in both cases, representations, which we cannot apply to any determinate object."
     "But it may well appear strange that reason, whose proper duty it is to prescribe rules of discipline to all the other powers of the mind, should itself require this corrective."
     "Compelled, therefore, by that necessity with which the conception of substance forces itself upon us, we must confess that it has its seat in our faculty of cognition à priori."
     "General logic, then, resolves the whole formal business of understanding and reason into its elements, and exhibits them as principles of all logical judging of our cognitions."
     "Happiness is the satisfaction of all our desires; extensive, in regard to their multiplicity; intensive, in regard to their degree; and protensive, in regard to their duration."
     "He does this solely with the view of removing from the mind of the reader any doubts which might affect his judgement of the work as a whole, and in regard to its ultimate aim."
     "It must take up its abode only in the region of complete certitude, whether this relates to the cognition of objects themselves, or to the limits which bound all our cognition."
     "Moreover, these parts cannot antecede this one all-embracing space, as the component parts from which the aggregate can be made up, but can be cogitated only as existing in it."
     "Now the practical reference is either to skill or to morality; to the former, when the end proposed is arbitrary and accidental, to the latter, when it is absolutely necessary."
     "So far as the faculty of sense may contain representations à priori, which form the conditions under which objects are given, in so far it belongs to transcendental philosophy."
     "That is to say, if we consider the subject strictly, the truth of the rule, which has been employed as an hypothesis, does not follow from the use that is made of it by reason."
     "This philosopher’s celebrated doctrine of space and time, in which he intellectualized these forms of sensibility, originated in the same delusion of transcendental reflection."
     "Time, as the formal condition of the manifold of the internal sense, consequently of the conjunction of all representations, contains à priori a manifold in the pure intuition."
     "Accordingly, in the series of these perceptions, there was no determined order, which necessitated my beginning at a certain point, in order empirically to connect the manifold."
     "After such an inquiry, arrogant claims would have to be given up on both sides; but the sovereignty of reason over understanding and sense would be based upon a sure foundation."
     "But as regards the empirical criterion of this necessary permanence, and with it of the substantiality of phenomena, we shall find sufficient opportunity to speak in the sequel."
     "In like manner, in transcendental logic, infinite must be distinguished from affirmative judgements, although in general logic they are rightly enough classed under affirmative."
     "In such an antinomy, therefore, we did not consider the object, that is, the conditioned, but the series of conditions belonging to the object, and the magnitude of that series."
     "In this way the transcendental enlargement of our rational cognition would be, not the cause, but merely the effect of the practical teleology which pure reason imposes upon us."
     "It is distinguished from culture, which aims at the formation of a certain degree of skill, without attempting to repress or to destroy any other mental power, already existing."
     "It would be vain to philosophize upon the triangle, that is, to reflect on it discursively; I should get no further than the definition with which I had been obliged to set out."
     "Now in space there is nothing real that is at the same time simple; for points, which are the only simple things in space, are merely limits, but not constituent parts of space."
     "Now to these conceptions relate four paralogisms of a transcendental psychology, which is falsely held to be a science of pure reason, touching the nature of our thinking being."
     "The sensuous world contains nothing but phenomena, which are mere representations, and always sensuously conditioned; things in themselves are not, and cannot be, objects to us."
     "As such it may indeed fall within the province of pure reason, but still it is not transcendental, but moral, and consequently cannot in itself form the subject of our criticism."
     "Besides, I am here speaking only of the simple, in so far as it is necessarily given in the composite — the latter being capable of solution into the former as its component parts."
     "But that the I which thinks, must be considered as in thought always a subject, and as a thing which cannot be a predicate to thought, is an apodeictic and identical proposition."
     "But the synthesis of the manifold parts of space — (the syntheses whereby we apprehend space) — is nevertheless successive; it takes place, therefore, in time, and contains a series."
     "But this absolutely complete synthesis is itself but an idea; for it is impossible, at least before hand, to know whether any such synthesis is possible in the case of phenomena."
     "At the same time, it must be carefully borne in mind that, while we surrender the power of /cognizing/, we still reserve the power of /thinking/ objects, as things in themselves."
     "Both are transcendental, not merely because they themselves precede à priori all experience, but also because they form the basis for the possibility of other cognition à priori."
     "But space considered in itself contains nothing movable, consequently motion must be something which is found in space only through experience — in other words, an empirical datum."
     "For this conception demands that something, A, should be of such a nature that something else, B, should follow from it necessarily, and according to an absolutely universal law."
     "In the general principles of morals there can be nothing uncertain, for the propositions are either utterly without meaning, or must originate solely in our rational conceptions."
     "It is now perfectly evident that transcendental questions admit only of transcendental answers — those presented à priori by pure conceptions without the least empirical admixture."
     "It is, obviously, a much more difficult task for reason to strike into the sure path of science, where it has to deal not simply with itself, but with objects external to itself."
     "Now the consciousness of a homogeneous manifold in intuition, in so far as thereby the representation of an object is rendered possible, is the conception of a quantity (quanti)."
     "The object of a conception which is self-contradictory, is nothing, because the conception is nothing — is impossible, as a figure composed of two straight lines (nihil negativum)."
     "This cause and its causality exist therefore out of and apart from the series of phenomena; while its effects do exist and are discoverable in the series of empirical conditions."
     "Thus our conception of time explains the possibility of so much synthetical knowledge à priori, as is exhibited in the general doctrine of motion, which is not a little fruitful."
     "To this transcendental object we may attribute the whole connection and extent of our possible perceptions, and say that it is given and exists in itself prior to all experience."
     "Axioms are, for this reason, always self-evident, while philosophical principles, whatever may be the degree of certainty they possess, cannot lay any claim to such a distinction."
     "First, then, the transcendental ideas are properly nothing but categories elevated to the unconditioned; and they may be arranged in a table according to the titles of the latter."
     "Against these general considerations, the justice of which no one can dispute, one argument is adduced, which is regarded as furnishing a satisfactory demonstration from the fact."
     "Among philosophers, David Hume came the nearest of all to this problem; yet it never acquired in his mind sufficient precision, nor did he regard the question in its universality."
     "But as we have both pure and empirical intuitions (as transcendental æsthetic proves), in like manner a distinction might be drawn between pure and empirical thought (of objects)."
     "Consequently the categories do not, even by means of pure intuition afford us any cognition of things; they can only do so in so far as they can be applied to empirical intuition."
     "If by intelligible objects we understand things which can be thought by means of the pure categories, without the need of the schemata of sensibility, such objects are impossible."
     "Reality, in the pure conception of the understanding, is that which corresponds to a sensation in general; that, consequently, the conception of which indicates a being (in time)."
     "That which belongs only to the condition or state of a substance, even although it possesses a quantity (motion or change, for example), likewise does not consist of simple parts."
     "The synthesis of the conditioned with its condition, and the complete series of the latter (in the major) are not limited by time, and do not contain the conception of succession."
     "Thirdly, there is perfection — which consists in this, that the plurality falls back upon the unity of the conception, and accords completely with that conception and with no other."
     "Thus, number is nothing else than the unity of the synthesis of the manifold in a homogeneous intuition, by means of my generating time itself in my apprehension of the intuition."
     "Whether this or that supposed experience be purely imaginary must be discovered from its particular determinations and by comparing these with the criteria of all real experience."
     "But the only existence cognized, under the condition of other given phenomena, as necessary, is the existence of effects from given causes in conformity with the laws of causality."
     "For all diversities must be related to each other, as they all spring from one highest genus, descending through the different gradations of a more and more extended determination."
     "But I pass by everything which derives its possibility from reality in experience, and I purpose treating here merely of the possibility of things by means of à priori conceptions."
     "But this identity of the subject, of which I am conscious in all its representations, does not relate to or concern the intuition of the subject, by which it is given as an object."
     "In our Transcendental Analytic, for example, we inferred the principle: Every event has a cause, from the only condition of the objective possibility of our conception of an event."
     "It frequently happens that a man delivers his opinions with so much boldness and assurance, that he appears to be under no apprehension as to the possibility of his being in error."
     "Nay, the representation of them is a mere schema, that always relates to the reproductive imagination, which calls up the objects of experience, without which they have no meaning."
     "Nevertheless, the recognition of this rule, as a condition of the synthetical unity of phenomena in time, was the ground of experience itself and consequently preceded it à priori."
     "Reason does not hold her possessions upon sufferance; for, although she cannot show a perfectly satisfactory title to them, no one can prove that she is not the rightful possessor."
     "The holding of a thing to be true is a phenomenon in our understanding which may rest on objective grounds, but requires, also, subjective causes in the mind of the person judging."
     "Upon the solution of this problem, or upon sufficient proof of the impossibility of synthetical knowledge à priori, depends the existence or downfall of the science of metaphysics."
     "We should accordingly, have to form both an empirical and an intellectual conception of the causality of such a faculty or power — both, however, having reference to the same effect."
     "What we have now set forth teaches, therefore, the empirical reality of time; that is, its objective validity in reference to all objects which can ever be presented to our senses."
     "When the grounds upon which we seek to base a cognition are too various or too profound, we try whether or not we may not discover the truth of our cognition from its consequences."
     "A certain dim consciousness of the true use of this idea seems to have dictated to the philosophers of all times the moderate language used by them regarding the cause of the world."
     "According to this principle, for example, all evils are but consequences of the limited nature of created beings, that is, negations, because these are the only opposite of reality."
     "He may analyse the conception of a right line, of an angle, or of the number three as long as he pleases, but he will not discover any properties not contained in these conceptions."
     "Hence truth and error, consequently also, illusory appearance as the cause of error, are only to be found in a judgement, that is, in the relation of an object to our understanding."
     "If this were not the case, we should have found in the world of phenomena the highest ground or condition of unity — which is impossible, according to the second regulative principle."
     "A belief in the reciprocal causality of phenomena is necessary, if we are required to look for and to present the natural conditions of natural events, that is to say, their causes."
     "Before ending this transcendental analytic, we must make an addition, which, although in itself of no particular importance, seems to be necessary to the completeness of the system."
     "But, as the synthesis of imagination has for its aim no single intuition, but merely unity in the determination of sensibility, the schema is clearly distinguishable from the image."
     "In like manner, the principles of mathematical science form no part of this system, because they are all drawn from intuition, and not from the pure conception of the understanding."
     "In the former part of our transcendental logic, we defined the understanding to be the faculty of rules; reason may be distinguished from understanding as the faculty of principles."
     "In this Preface I treat the new metaphysical method as a hypothesis with the view of rendering apparent the first attempts at such a change of method, which are always hypothetical."
     "The possibility of things must therefore be regarded as derived — except that of the thing which contains in itself all reality, which must be considered to be primitive and original."
     "The principle of causality, and, by consequence, the mechanism of nature as determined by causality, would then have absolute validity in relation to all things as efficient causes."
     "Thus the mere form of external sensuous intuition, namely, space, affords us, per se, no cognition; it merely contributes the manifold in à priori intuition to a possible cognition."
     "To suppose the existence of a triangle and not that of its three angles, is self-contradictory; but to suppose the non-existence of both triangle and angles is perfectly admissible."
     "We know nothing more than our mode of perceiving them, which is peculiar to us, and which, though not of necessity pertaining to every animated being, is so to the whole human race."
     "We shall thus ascertain whether, from the point of view of its practical interest, reason may not be able to supply us with that which, on the speculative side, it wholly denies us."
     "When a substance passes from one state, a, into another state, b, the point of time in which the latter exists is different from, and subsequent to that in which the former existed."
     "But if they are to possess the least objective validity, and to represent anything but mere creations of thought (entia rationis ratiocinantis), a deduction of them must be possible."
     "But the causality of such an intelligible cause is not determined or determinable by phenomena; although its effects, as phenomena, must be determined by other phenomenal existences."
     "But this cannot be obtained otherwise than by a complete division of parts, whereby the real in matter becomes either nothing or that which is not matter, that is to say, the simple."
     "But, if he were called to action, the play of the merely speculative reason would disappear like the shapes of a dream, and practical interest would dictate his choice of principles."
     "For how can we have any experience or perception of an absolute void? But the absolute totality of the empirical synthesis requires that the unconditioned be an empirical conception."
     "For it is perfectly permissible to employ, in the presence of reason, the language of a firmly rooted faith, even after we have been obliged to renounce all pretensions to knowledge."
     "For since reason commands that such actions should take place, it must be possible for them to take place; and hence a particular kind of systematic unity — the moral — must be possible."
     "For we should thus have a whole containing a series of members which could not be completed in any regress — which is infinite, and at the same time complete in an organized composite."
     "I maintain, then, that the possibility of things is not derived from such conceptions per se, but only when considered as formal and objective conditions of an experience in general."
     "I have merely mentioned these questions, that in treating of the conception of the understanding, there might be no omission of anything that, in the common opinion, belongs to them."
     "If by the term theology I understand the cognition of a primal being, that cognition is based either upon reason alone (theologia rationalis) or upon revelation (theologia revelata)."
     "It must be admitted that this has not been the case and that, owing to the unfitness of the common understanding for such subtle speculations, it can never be expected to take place."
     "It would be quite correct to say that it originates or begins its effects in the world of sense from itself, although the action productive of these effects does not begin in itself."
     "Space is merely the form of external intuition, but not a real object which can itself be externally intuited; it is not a correlate of phenomena, it is the form of phenomena itself."
     "The affinity of the diverse, notwithstanding the differences existing between its parts, has a relation to things, but a still closer one to the mere properties and powers of things."
     "The opposition of the judgements which follow makes it evident that a fallacy lay in the initial supposition, and thus helps us to discover the true constitution of objects of sense."
     "The strife of dialectic is a necessity of reason, and we cannot but wish that it had been conducted long ere this with that perfect freedom which ought to be its essential condition."
     "The third unites both the former, by enouncing the fact of homogeneity as existing even in the most various diversity, by means of the gradual transition from one species to another."
     "A complete insight into and comprehension of them would render Theology, Ethics, and, through the conjunction of both, Religion, solely dependent on the speculative faculty of reason."
     "But I find that I can apply none of the categories to this object, the schema of these categories, which is the condition of their application, being given only in sensuous intuition."
     "Accordingly, we are accustomed to say that the former is a cognition which represents the object itself, whilst the latter presents only a particular appearance or phenomenon thereof."
     "As general logic, it makes abstraction of all content of the cognition of the understanding, and of the difference of objects, and has to do with nothing but the mere form of thought."
     "Conceptions may be logically compared without the trouble of inquiring to what faculty their objects belong, whether as noumena, to the understanding, or as phenomena, to sensibility."
     "It contains, moreover, a transcendental presupposition — that, namely, of the material for all possibility, which must contain à priori the data for this or that particular possibility."
     "It is affirmed that there is one and only one conception, in which the non-being or annihilation of the object is self-contradictory, and this is the conception of an ens realissimum."
     "It is our duty, therefore, to try to discover new objections, to put weapons in the bands of our opponent, and to grant him the most favourable position in the arena that he can wish."
     "Logical illusion, which consists merely in the imitation of the form of reason (the illusion in sophistical syllogisms), arises entirely from a want of due attention to logical rules."
     "Nay, more, I shall in the sequel show that absolute necessity does not by any means depend on internal necessity, and that, therefore, it must not be considered as synonymous with it."
     "Now, that in the sphere of human cognition we have judgements which are necessary, and in the strictest sense universal, consequently pure à priori, it will be an easy matter to show."
     "There are, in addition to transcendental philosophy, only two pure sciences of reason; the one with a speculative, the other with a practical content — pure mathematics and pure ethics."
     "This reasoner has at heart the interest of diversity — in accordance with the principle of specification; another, the interest of unity — in accordance with the principle of aggregation."
     "To take another example, when I perceive the freezing of water, I apprehend two states (fluidity and solidity), which, as such, stand toward each other mutually in a relation of time."
     "Unless we pay particular attention to this requirement, our proofs, instead of pursuing the straight path indicated by reason, follow the tortuous road of mere subjective association."
     "We have nothing to fear from these concessions; on the contrary, we may rather hope that we shall thus make ourselves master of a possession which no one will ever venture to dispute."
     "But if I take the matter which is indicated by this name, and submit it to the examination of my senses, I am enabled to form several synthetical — although still empirical — propositions."
     "But this is exactly what was maintained in the ontological argument, and not recognized by the cosmological, although it formed the real ground of its disguised and illusory reasoning."
     "But this rule is always to be met with in the perception of that which happens, and it makes the order of the successive perceptions in the apprehension of such a phenomenon necessary."
     "For it was these very laws, the internal practical necessity of which led us to the hypothesis of an independent cause, or of a wise ruler of the universe, who should give them effect."
     "If I am required to pass, à priori, beyond the conception of an object, I find that it is utterly impossible without the guidance of something which is not contained in the conception."
     "Absolutely possible would in this sense signify that which is possible in all relations and in every respect; and this is the most that can be predicated of the possibility of a thing."
     "Astronomy, in so far as we mean by the word the mere observation of the starry heaven, may represent the former; a system of astronomy, such as the Copernican or Newtonian, the latter."
     "For these reasons we have chosen to denominate this part of logic dialectic, in the sense of a critique of dialectical illusion, and we wish the term to be so understood in this place."
     "For this purpose intuition of self is required, and this intuition possesses a form given à priori, namely, time, which is sensuous, and belongs to our receptivity of the determinable."
     "If we are in possession of the original and primitive, the deduced and subsidiary conceptions can easily be added, and the genealogical tree of the understanding completely delineated."
     "These may, indeed, not be false, but we do not know them to be true, because the only witness to their certitude is the hypothesis which they themselves have been called in to explain."
     "At the same time, this connection with the world of experience does not in the least augment the conception, although a possible perception has been added to the experience of the mind."
     "But as we are now about to proceed to the consideration of the dynamical conceptions of the understanding, and their adequateness with ideas, we must not lose sight of this distinction."
     "For every conception are requisite, firstly, the logical form of a conception (of thought) general; and, secondly, the possibility of presenting to this an object to which it may apply."
     "For without this unity we should not even possess reason, because we should have no school for reason, and no cultivation through objects which afford the materials for its conceptions."
     "But it belongs to logic alone, because it is valid of cognitions, merely as cognitions and without respect to their content, and declares that the contradiction entirely nullifies them."
     "But the spontaneity of thought requires that this diversity be examined after a certain manner, received into the mind, and connected, in order afterwards to form a cognition out of it."
     "In the case of a whole composed of substances, which is cogitated solely by the pure understanding, it may be necessary to be in possession of the simple before composition is possible."
     "In this view, negations are nothing but limitations — a term which could not, with propriety, be applied to them, if the unlimited (the all) did not form the true basis of our conception."
     "In truth, there does always remain to the pure conceptions of the understanding, after abstracting every sensuous condition, a value and significance, which is, however, merely logical."
     "It no longer objective we, make abstraction of the sensuousness of our intuition, in other words, of that mode of representation which is peculiar to us, and speak of things in general."
     "Masters in the science of mathematics are confident of the success of this method; indeed, it is a common persuasion that it is capable of being applied to any subject of human thought."
     "My purpose, in the above remark, is merely this: to guard any one against illustrating the asserted ideality of space by examples quite insufficient, for example, by colour, taste, etc."
     "Nay, more, this chance-conception, now become so current, many have endeavoured to explain by examples which seemed to render any inquiries regarding its intelligibility quite needless."
     "Now because all effect consists in that which happens, therefore in the changeable, the last subject thereof is the permanent, as the substratum of all that changes, that is, substance."
     "Now the understanding cognizes only by means of conceptions; consequently, how far soever it may proceed in division, never by mere intuition, but always by lower and lower conceptions."
     "Now, the possibility of a thing can never be proved from the fact that the conception of it is not self-contradictory, but only by means of an intuition corresponding to the conception."
     "Synthetical unity of the manifold in intuitions, as given à priori, is therefore the foundation of the identity of apperception itself, which antecedes à priori all determinate thought."
     "This idea, accordingly, demands complete unity in the cognition of the understanding — not the unity of a contingent aggregate, but that of a system connected according to necessary laws."
     "Without this presupposition we could not represent to ourselves that things exist together at one and the same time, or at different times, that is, contemporaneously, or in succession."
     "For we come to the conclusion that our faculty of cognition is unable to transcend the limits of possible experience; and yet this is precisely the most essential object of this science."
     "It is not merely through my thinking that I cognize an object, but only through my determining a given intuition in relation to the unity of consciousness in which all thinking consists."
     "Just as little does this regulative principle exclude the assumption of an intelligible cause, when the question regards merely the pure employment of reason — in relation to ends or aims."
     "On the contrary, we are free to consider all limited beings as likewise unconditionally necessary, although we are unable to infer this from the general conception which we have of them."

     "The dogmatical theory of idealism is unavoidable, if we regard space as a property of things in themselves; for in that case it is, with all to which it serves as condition, a nonentity."
     "This I am enabled to do, by regarding all connections and relations in the world of sense, as if they were the dispositions of a supreme reason, of which our reason is but a faint image."
     "Thus metaphysics necessarily fell back into the antiquated and rotten constitution of /dogmatism/, and again became obnoxious to the contempt from which efforts had been made to save it."
     "To this single idea must the revolution be ascribed, by which, after groping in the dark for so many centuries, natural science was at length conducted into the path of certain progress."
     "We have already traced to their sources the conceptions of space and time, by means of a transcendental deduction, and we have explained and determined their objective validity à priori."
     "When from the existence of the universe and the things in it the existence of a cause of the universe is inferred, reason is proceeding not in the natural, but in the speculative method."
     "And this is actually the case with all cosmological conceptions, which, for the reason above mentioned, involve reason, so long as it remains attached to them, in an unavoidable antinomy."
     "But as this can only be sufficiently demonstrated in that part of our treatise which relates to the dialectical conclusions of reason, we shall omit any consideration of it in this place."
     "But, although it is impossible to discover in intuition a schema for the complete systematic unity of all the conceptions of the understanding, there must be some analogon of this schema."
     "Experience demonstrates to us the existence of practical freedom as one of the causes which exist in nature, that is, it shows the causal power of reason in the determination of the will."
     "For otherwise succession, which is always found in perceptions as apprehensions, would be predicated of external objects, and their representation of their coexistence be thus impossible."
     "For the conception of totality itself is in the present case the representation of a completed synthesis of the parts; and this completion, and consequently its conception, is impossible."
     "For the predicates of very great, astonishing, or immeasurable power and excellence, give us no determinate conception of the thing, nor do they inform us what the thing may be in itself."
     "Hence it follows that the criterion of necessity is to be found only in the law of possible experience — that everything which happens is determined à priori in the phenomenon by its cause."
     "If we say of a thing that in relation to some other thing it is too large or too small, the former is considered as existing for the sake of the latter, and requiring to be adapted to it."
     "Every mode of explanation which does not show us this possibility, although in appearance it may be similar to ours, can with the utmost certainty be distinguished from it by these marks."
     "I mentioned above that this cosmological argument contains a perfect nest of dialectical assumptions, which transcendental criticism does not find it difficult to expose and to dissipate."
     "If, in an identical judgement, I annihilate the predicate in thought, and retain the subject, a contradiction is the result; and hence I say, the former belongs necessarily to the latter."
     "In so far as regard is here had merely to the synthesis of the homogeneous (the units), it cannot take place except in one manner, although our use of these numbers is afterwards general."
     "It is the consciousness of the relation of given representations to the different sources or faculties of cognition, by which alone their relation to each other can be rightly determined."
     "Philosophy possesses, then, no axioms, and has no right to impose its à priori principles upon thought, until it has established their authority and validity by a thoroughgoing deduction."
     "Reason believes that it has discovered these requisites in the conception of an ens realissimum — and in it alone, and hence concludes: The ens realissimum is an absolutely necessary being."
     "Reason is present and the same in all human actions and at all times; but it does not itself exist in time, and therefore does not enter upon any state in which it did not formerly exist."
     "Reason will not follow the order of things presented by experience, but, with perfect spontaneity, rearranges them according to ideas, with which it compels empirical conditions to agree."
     "Respecting these sciences, as they do certainly exist, it may with propriety be asked, how they are possible? — for that they must be possible is shown by the fact of their really existing."
     "The cause of this belief is to be found in the fact that we necessarily attribute to things à priori all the properties which constitute conditions under which alone we can cogitate them."
     "The cosmological principle of totality could not give us any certain knowledge in regard to the maximum in the series of conditions in the world of sense, considered as a thing in itself."
     "Thus the architectonic interest of reason, which requires a unity — not empirical, but à priori and rational — forms a natural recommendation for the assertions of the thesis in our antinomy."
     "Thus, and thus only, can the principle of final unity aid in the extension of the employment of reason in the sphere of experience, without being in any case detrimental to its interests."
     "We attend, in the first argument, solely to the absolute totality of the series of conditions, the one of which determines the other in time, and thus arrive at a necessary unconditioned."
     "We find this transcendental presupposition lurking in different forms in the principles of philosophers, although they have neither recognized it nor confessed to themselves its presence."
     "Without looking upon myself as a remarkably combative person, I shall not decline the challenge to detect the fallacy and destroy the pretensions of every attempt of speculative theology."
     "But, on the other hand, this consideration ought to elevate and to give it confidence, for this discipline is exercised by itself alone, and it is subject to the censure of no other power."
     "A primal being cannot be said to consist of many other beings with an existence which is derivative, for the latter presuppose the former, and therefore cannot be constitutive parts of it."
     "An understanding, in which all the manifold should be given by means of consciousness itself, would be intuitive; our understanding can only think and must look for its intuition to sense."
     "By the word synthesis, in its most general signification, I understand the process of joining different representations to each other and of comprehending their diversity in one cognition."
     "Finally, it is obvious that there exists among the transcendental ideas a certain connection and unity, and that pure reason, by means of them, collects all its cognitions into one system."
     "In this case the regress could never be cogitated as complete; or, if this was the case, a member really conditioned was falsely regarded as a primal member, consequently as unconditioned."
     "Now from this cause it happens that the subjective necessity of a certain connection of our conceptions, is regarded as an objective necessity of the determination of things in themselves."
     "Otherwise, not exactly the same, but something more than what was cogitated in my conception, would exist, and I could not affirm that the exact object of my conception had real existence."
     "Reason would be unable to satisfy her own requirements, if she passed from a causality which she does know, to obscure and indemonstrable principles of explanation which she does not know."
     "The impossibility in such a case does not rest upon the conception in itself, but upon the construction of it in space, that is to say, upon the conditions of space and its determinations."
     "The proper ground of this fact is that all change to be perceived as change presupposes something permanent in intuition, while in the internal sense no permanent intuition is to be found."
     "The supreme principle of the possibility of it in relation to the understanding is that all the manifold in it be subject to conditions of the originally synthetical unity or apperception."
     "The very same grounds of proof which established in the thesis the existence of a supreme being, demonstrated in the antithesis — and with equal strictness — the non-existence of such a being."
     "And this remark holds good in all cases, when we speak of a progressus, that is, an advancement from the condition to the conditioned; this possible advancement always proceeds to infinity."
     "Before attempting this solution, a task which transcendental philosophy cannot decline, it will be advisable to make a remark with regard to its procedure in the settlement of the question."
     "But the existence of external things is absolutely requisite for this purpose, so that it follows that internal experience is itself possible only mediately and through external experience."
     "I therefore do not represent myself in thought either as I am, or as I appear to myself; I merely cogitate myself as an object in general, of the mode of intuiting which I make abstraction."
     "If, indeed, they were nothing more than maxims for the speculative exercise of reason, he gives evidence therein a more genuine philosophic spirit than any of the philosophers of antiquity."
     "Both parties beat the air and fight with their own shadows, as they pass beyond the limits of nature, and can find no tangible point of attack — no firm footing for their dogmatical conflict."
     "But places always presuppose intuitions which are to limit or determine them; and we cannot conceive either space or time composed of constituent parts which are given before space or time."
     "Consequently they will not possess that immediate evidence which is peculiar to the former, although their application to experience does not, for that reason, lose its truth and certitude."
     "For, if these objections hold good, we deny to space, and with it to all mathematics, objective validity, and no longer know wherefore, and how far, mathematics can be applied to phenomena."
     "I am sorry to remark the same tendency to misrepresentation and hypocrisy in the sphere of speculative discussion, where there is less temptation to restrain the free expression of thought."
     "In regard to the second part of the thesis, the difficulty as to an infinite and yet elapsed series disappears; for the manifold of a world infinite in extension is contemporaneously given."
     "Nay, more, this intellectual series is not tied to any sensuous conditions; and is therefore free from the condition of time, which requires it spontaneously to begin its causality in time."
     "Now the propositions of pure reason, especially when they transcend the limits of possible experience, do not admit of our making any experiment with their /objects/, as in natural science."
     "Now this active subject would, in its character of intelligible subject, be subordinate to no conditions of time, for time is only a condition of phenomena, and not of things in themselves."
     "The former, as the source of all our synthetical conjunction, applies, under the name of the categories, to the manifold of intuition in general, prior to all sensuous intuition of objects."
     "The latter belongs to the principles of modality, which to the determination of causality adds the conception of necessity, which is itself, however, subject to a rule of the understanding."
     "The principle of the relation of causality in the succession of phenomena is therefore valid for all objects of experience, because it is itself the ground of the possibility of experience."
     "The proposition is therefore not analytical, but synthetical, and nevertheless conceived à priori; and so it is with regard to the other propositions of the pure part of natural philosophy."
     "This relation, then, does not exist because I accompany every representation with consciousness, but because I join one representation to another, and am conscious of the synthesis of them."
     "Thus, the schemata of the pure conceptions of the understanding are the true and only conditions whereby our understanding receives an application to objects, and consequently significance."
     "To the question /How?/ we are no more able to reply, than we are, in general, to think the stationary in time, the coexistence of which with the variable, produces the conception of change."
     "But while the notion of possibility is merely the notion of a position of thing in relation to the understanding (its empirical use), reality is the conjunction of the thing with perception."
     "Consequently, things, as phenomena, determine space; that is to say, they render it possible that, of all the possible predicates of space (size and relation), certain may belong to reality."
     "For although we posit a thing corresponding to the idea — a something, an actual existence — we do not on that account aim at the extension of our cognition by means of transcendent conceptions."
     "Hence, with him, space and time were possible — the former through the relation of substances, the latter through the connection of their determinations with each other, as causes and effects."
     "As to the intuitions of other thinking beings, we cannot judge whether they are or are not bound by the same conditions which limit our own intuition, and which for us are universally valid."
     "But the analysis of the experiences in which they are met with is not deduction, but only an illustration of them, because from experience they could never derive the attribute of necessity."
     "But the internal intuition in which alone my existence can be determined, though preceded by that purely intellectual consciousness, is itself sensible and attached to the condition of time."
     "For the faculty of sensibility not only does not present us with an indistinct and confused cognition of objects as things in themselves, but, in fact, gives us no knowledge of these at all."
     "If a cognition is to have objective reality, that is, to relate to an object, and possess sense and meaning in respect to it, it is necessary that the object be given in some way or another."
     "In both these cases the principle of causality, which is valid only in the field of experience — useless and even meaningless beyond this region, would be diverted from its proper destination."
     "It has therefore empirical principles, although, at the same time, it is in so far general, that it applies to the exercise of the understanding, without regard to the difference of objects."
     "Now the question is whether there do not exist, à priori in the mind, conceptions of understanding also, as conditions under which alone something, if not intuited, is yet thought as object."
     "Such will now recognize the fact that, according to the principles of this Critique, if we consider not what is, but what ought to be the case, there can be really no polemic of pure reason."
     "The causality of the necessary cause of changes, and consequently the cause itself, must for these reasons belong to time — and to phenomena, time being possible only as the form of phenomena."
     "The idea of a fundamental power, the existence of which no effort of logic can assure us of, is the problem to be solved, for the systematic representation of the existing variety of powers."
     "The simple is never presented in experience; and, if by substance is here meant the permanent object of sensuous intuition, the possibility of a simple phenomenon is perfectly inconceivable."
     "This philosopher found his ideas especially in all that is practical, that is, which rests upon freedom, which in its turn ranks under cognitions that are the peculiar product of reason."
     "But what other internal attributes of such an object can I think than those which my internal sense presents to me? That, to wit, which in either itself thought, or something analogous to it."
     "For suppose it to exist out of and apart from it, the series of cosmical changes would receive from it a beginning, and yet this necessary cause would not itself belong to the world of sense."
     "For to except even a single phenomenon from its operation is to exclude it from the sphere of possible experience and thus to admit it to be a mere fiction of thought or phantom of the brain."
     "As regards the second statement, let us first take the opposite for granted — that the world is finite and limited in space; it follows that it must exist in a void space, which is not limited."
     "But their number was, very happily, small; and thus they could not entirely put a stop to the exertions of those who persisted in raising new edifices, although on no settled or uniform plan."
     "In our reason, subjectively considered as a faculty of human cognition, there exist fundamental rules and maxims of its exercise, which have completely the appearance of objective principles."
     "In the one case it is necessary to find other members of the series, in the other it is necessary to inquire for others, inasmuch as experience presents no absolute limitation of the regress."
     "In the proposition: All men are mortal, are contained the propositions: Some men are mortal, Nothing that is not mortal is a man, and these are therefore immediate conclusions from the first."
     "It is therefore completely different from all principles of the understanding, the use made of which is entirely immanent, their object and purpose being merely the possibility of experience."
     "Its internal conditions are its parts, and the parts of parts its remote conditions; so that in this case we find a regressive synthesis, the absolute totality of which is a demand of reason."
     "On the contrary, the conception always relates immediately to the schema of the imagination, as a rule for the determination of our intuition, in conformity with a certain general conception."
     "Space, therefore, cannot be regarded as absolutely and in itself something determinative of the existence of things, because it is not itself an object, but only the form of possible objects."
     "That the understanding, therefore, cannot make of its à priori principles, or even of its conceptions, other than an empirical use, is a proposition which leads to the most important results."
     "The pure cosmological proof demonstrates the existence of a necessary being, but at the same time leaves it quite unsettled, whether this being is the world itself, or quite distinct from it."
     "The table of this division of the conception of nothing (the corresponding division of the conception of something does not require special description) must therefore be arranged as follows:"
     "The unity of consciousness, which lies at the basis of the categories, is considered to be an intuition of the subject as an object; and the category of substance is applied to the intuition."
     "Thus, it is evident that the understanding is capable of being instructed by rules, but that the judgement is a peculiar talent, which does not, and cannot require tuition, but only exercise."
     "To cogitate the latter in regard to its internal possibility, that is, to determine the application of the categories to it, no idea is required — no representation which transcends experience."
     "We can also, however, make a positive use of this principle, that is, not merely to banish falsehood and error (in so far as it rests upon contradiction), but also for the cognition of truth."
     "We have now not only traversed the region of the pure understanding and carefully surveyed every part of it, but we have also measured it, and assigned to everything therein its proper place."
     "All conceptions, therefore, and with them all principles, however high the degree of their à priori possibility, relate to empirical intuitions, that is, to data towards a possible experience."
     "Even reason, unbiased by private ends, or interested considerations, cannot judge otherwise, if it puts itself in the place of a being whose business it is to dispense all happiness to others."
     "Although, therefore, the solution of these problems is unattainable through experience, we must not permit ourselves to say that it is uncertain how the object of our inquiries is constituted."
     "But it is evident from what has been said on æsthetic that the first condition, under which alone objects can be intuited, must in fact exist, as a formal basis for them, à priori in the mind."
     "But the idea of an ought or of duty indicates a possible action, the ground of which is a pure conception; while the ground of a merely natural action is, on the contrary, always a phenomenon."
     "But the substratum of all reality, that is, of all that pertains to the existence of things, is substance; all that pertains to existence can be cogitated only as a determination of substance."
     "For although a cognition may be perfectly accurate as to logical form, that is, not self-contradictory, it is notwithstanding quite possible that it may not stand in agreement with its object."
     "Here a distinction presents itself, in regard to the way in which we may cogitate a presupposition — a distinction which is somewhat subtle, but of great importance in transcendental philosophy."
     "In this mode of viewing them, both principles, in their purely heuristic and regulative character, and as concerning merely the formal interest of reason, are quite consistent with each other."
     "It is clear that we cannot make the special conditions of sensibility into conditions of the possibility of things, but only of the possibility of their existence as far as they are phenomena."
     "It is, in fact, the same as the /empirical consciousness of my existence/, which can only be determined in relation to something, which, while connected with my existence, is /external to me/."
     "Its principle was that of pure empiricism, not only in the explication of the phenomena in the world, but also in the solution of the transcendental ideas, even of that of the universe itself."
     "Nay, it is also quite unknown to us whether any such transcendental or extraordinary cognition is possible under any circumstances, at least, whether it is possible by means of our categories."
     "Now, one conception cannot be connected synthetically and yet immediately with another; because, if we wish to proceed out of and beyond a conception, a third mediating cognition is necessary."
     "The general conception of a reality cannot be divided à priori, because, without the aid of experience, we cannot know any determinate kinds of reality, standing under the former as the genus."
     "These relatively fundamental powers must again be compared with each other, to discover, if possible, the one radical and absolutely fundamental power of which they are but the manifestations."
     "They cannot, therefore, be admitted to be real in themselves; they can only possess a comparative reality — that of a schema of the regulative principle of the systematic unity of all cognition."
     "This highest cause — what magnitude shall we attribute to it? Of the content of the world we are ignorant; still less can we estimate its magnitude by comparison with the sphere of the possible."
     "This it does that it may be able to give absolute completeness to the empirical synthesis, by continuing it to the unconditioned (which is not to be found in experience, but only in the idea)."
     "We observe in the world manifest signs of an arrangement full of purpose, executed with great wisdom, and argument in whole of a content indescribably various, and of an extent without limits."
     "Again, if the universe contains in itself everything that exists, it cannot be similar or dissimilar to any other thing, because there is, in fact, no other thing with which it can be compared."
     "But this unity is nothing more than the unity in thought, by which no object is given; to which therefore the category of substance — which always presupposes a given intuition — cannot be applied."
     "For it furnishes us with an indirect proof of the transcendental ideality of phenomena, if our minds were not completely satisfied with the direct proof set forth in the Trancendental Æsthetic."
     "For the regulative law of systematic unity requires us to study nature on the supposition that systematic and final unity in infinitum is everywhere discoverable, even in the highest diversity."
     "For we may have a determinate notion of a maximum and an absolutely perfect, all the restrictive conditions which are connected with an indeterminate and various content having been abstracted."
     "Hence I say that I have not merely the opinion, but the strong belief, on the correctness of which I would stake even many of the advantages of life, that there are inhabitants in other worlds."
     "Accordingly, I have named these principles rather with reference to their application than their content; and I shall now proceed to consider them in the order in which they stand in the table."
     "And, as experience is cognition by means of conjoined perceptions, the categories are conditions of the possibility of experience and are therefore valid à priori for all objects of experience."
     "But the pure schema of quantity (quantitatis) as a conception of the understanding, is number, a representation which comprehends the successive addition of one to one (homogeneous quantities)."
     "For, precisely because a singular judgement has no extent at all, its predicate cannot refer to a part of that which is contained in the conception of the subject and be excluded from the rest."
     "If this Critique itself does not assume the title of transcendental philosophy, it is only because, to be a complete system, it ought to contain a full analysis of all human knowledge à priori."
     "If, after all our inquiries and explanations, any one still hesitates to abandon the mere transcendental use of the categories, let him attempt to construct with them a synthetical proposition."
     "In this case, nature is the complete and all-sufficient cause of every event; and condition and conditioned, cause and effect are contained in the same series, and necessitated by the same law."
     "It is a melancholy reflection that reason, in its highest exercise, falls into an antithetic; and that the supreme tribunal for the settlement of differences should not be at union with itself."
     "It is, then, the matter of all phenomena that is given to us à posteriori; the form must lie ready à priori for them in the mind, and consequently can be regarded separately from all sensation."
     "Moral philosophy can always exhibit its principles, with their practical consequences, in concreto — at least in possible experiences, and thus escape the mistakes and ambiguities of abstraction."
     "Now connection is not an operation of mere sense and intuition, but is the product of a synthetical faculty of imagination, which determines the internal sense in respect of a relation of time."
     "Space and time are quanta continua, because no part of them can be given, without enclosing it within boundaries (points and moments), consequently, this given part is itself a space or a time."
     "Suppose that the conception of a triangle is given to a philosopher and that he is required to discover, by the philosophical method, what relation the sum of its angles bears to a right angle."
     "That which in the phenomenon corresponds to the sensation, I term its matter; but that which effects that the content of the phenomenon can be arranged under certain relations, I call its form."
     "The change, therefore, affects only the arrogant pretensions of the schools, which would gladly retain, in their own exclusive possession, the key to the truths which they impart to the public."
     "The critical solution, which may be a perfectly certain one, does not consider the question objectively, but proceeds by inquiring into the basis of the cognition upon which the question rests."
     "This principle authorizes me, beginning at the genus, to descend to the various and diverse contained under it; and in this way extension, as in the former case unity, is assured to the system."
     "This totality the understanding does not concern itself with; its only occupation is the connection of experiences, by which series of conditions in accordance with conceptions are established."
     "We must here remark, in the first place, that the idea of absolute totality relates to nothing but the exposition of phenomena, and therefore not to the pure conception of a totality of things."
     "Whether this latter purpose succeed or not, the idea is and must always be a true one, and its employment, when merely regulative, must always be accompanied by truthful and beneficial results."
     "But as the parts of space are not subordinated, but co-ordinated to each other, one part cannot be the condition of the possibility of the other; and space is not in itself, like time, a series."
     "But it is not an arbitrary or fictitious notion, but is connected with the limitation of sensibility, without, however, being capable of presenting us with any positive datum beyond this sphere."
     "Consciousness, therefore, is so constituted that, inasmuch as the thinking subject is at the same time its own object, it cannot divide itself — although it can divide its inhering determinations."
     "For, although divisibility presupposes composition, it does not necessarily require a composition of substances, but only of the degrees (of the several faculties) of one and the same substance."
     "If the empirical law of causality is to conduct us to a Supreme Being, this being must belong to the chain of empirical objects — in which case it would be, like all phenomena, itself conditioned."
     "But, secondly, all the categories are not available for this purpose, but only those in which the synthesis constitutes a series — of conditions subordinated to, not co-ordinated with, each other."
     "For here a new phenomenon of human reason meets us — a perfectly natural antithetic, which does not require to be sought for by subtle sophistry, but into which reason of itself unavoidably falls."
     "In this latter case, it may help us to form synthetical à priori judgements, but only in the discursive method, by conceptions, not in the intuitive, by means of the construction of conceptions."
     "It is not sufficient to find the conception of the simple for the pure conception of the composite, but we must discover for the intuition of the composite (matter), the intuition of the simple."
     "It may be said that the object of a merely transcendental idea is something of which we have no conception, although the idea may be a necessary product of reason according to its original laws."
     "Let each thinker pursue his own path; if he shows talent, if he gives evidence of profound thought, in one word, if he shows that he possesses the power of reasoning — reason is always the gainer."
     "Let us take, for example, the conception of cause, which indicates a peculiar kind of synthesis, namely, that with something, A, something entirely different, B, is connected according to a law."
     "Nor can she regard these conflicting trains of reasoning with indifference as mere passages at arms, still less can she command peace; for in the subject of the conflict she has a deep interest."
     "On the contrary, he stopped short at the synthetical proposition of the connection of an effect with its cause (principium causalitatis), insisting that such proposition à priori was impossible."
     "The former has an immediate relation to the object and is singular and individual; the latter has but a mediate relation, by means of a characteristic mark which may be common to several things."
     "The history of this intellectual revolution — much more important in its results than the discovery of the passage round the celebrated Cape of Good Hope — and of its author, has not been preserved."
     "The principle of reason is therefore properly a mere rule — prescribing a regress in the series of conditions for given phenomena, and prohibiting any pause or rest on an absolutely unconditioned."
     "Then I say that the coexistence of these cannot be an object of possible perception and that the existence of one cannot, by any mode of empirical synthesis, lead us to the existence of another."
     "These contradictions place the work in an unfavourable light in the eyes of those who rely on the judgement of others, but are easily reconciled by those who have mastered the idea of the whole."
     "They are, on the contrary, regarded as jealous enemies of our insatiable desire for knowledge; and it almost requires an apology to induce us to tolerate, much less to prize and to respect them."
     "To take the cognition out of one of these spheres, is equivalent to placing it in one of the others; and, on the other hand, to place it in one sphere is equivalent to taking it out of the rest."
     "We are not at present engaged with a logical dialectic, which makes complete abstraction of the content of cognition and aims only at unveiling the illusory appearance in the form of syllogisms."
     "Without this, our conceptions are empty, and we may indeed have thought by means of them, but by such thinking we have not, in fact, cognized anything, we have merely played with representation."
     "And, finally, they are transcendent, and overstep the limits of all experiences, in which, consequently, no object can ever be presented that would be perfectly adequate to a transcendental idea."
     "But both attempts are equally beyond our power — we find it impossible to satisfy the understanding upon this point, and as impossible to induce it to remain at rest in relation to this incapacity."
     "Either, then, it is impossible to annihilate composition in thought; or, after such annihilation, there must remain something that subsists without composition, that is, something that is simple."
     "All propositions, indeed, may be logically expressed in a negative form; but, in relation to the content of our cognition, the peculiar province of negative judgements is solely to prevent error."
     "But all laws of nature, without distinction, are subject to higher principles of the understanding, inasmuch as the former are merely applications of the latter to particular cases of experience."
     "I answer: It is absurd to introduce — under whatever term disguised — into the conception of a thing, which is to be cogitated solely in reference to its possibility, the conception of its existence."
     "If, on the other hand, a judgement carries with it strict and absolute universality, that is, admits of no possible exception, it is not derived from experience, but is valid absolutely à priori."
     "In obedience to this advice, intellectual hypotheses and faith would not be called in aid of our practical interests; nor should we introduce them under the pompous titles of science and insight."
     "In this manner, there arise exactly so many pure conceptions of the understanding, applying à priori to objects of intuition in general, as there are logical functions in all possible judgements."
     "My chief aim in this work has been thoroughness; and I make bold to say that there is not a single metaphysical problem that does not find its solution, or at least the key to its solution, here."
     "Possibility, existence, and necessity nobody has ever yet been able to explain without being guilty of manifest tautology, when the definition has been drawn entirely from the pure understanding."
     "The aim of the transcendental ideal formed by the mind is either to discover a conception which shall harmonize with the idea of absolute necessity, or a conception which shall contain that idea."
     "Thus, our numeration (and this is more observable in large numbers) is a synthesis according to conceptions, because it takes place according to a common basis of unity (for example, the decade)."
     "Understanding and judgement accordingly possess in transcendental logic a canon of objectively valid, and therefore true exercise, and are comprehended in the analytical department of that logic."
     "We represented in these antinomies the conditions of phenomena as belonging to the conditioned according to relations of space and time — which is the usual supposition of the common understanding."
     "And as I wish to prove the existence of simple substances, only in relation to, and as the elements of, the composite, I might term the antithesis of the second Antinomy, transcendental Atomistic."
     "For, as he can attempt such a proof solely upon the basis of pure reason, he is bound to prove that a Supreme Being, and a thinking subject in the character of a pure intelligence, are impossible."
     "For, in this case, error can have no more serious consequences than that, where we expected to discover a teleological connection (nexus finalis), only a mechanical or physical connection appears."
     "But space and time are not merely forms of sensuous intuition, but intuitions themselves (which contain a manifold), and therefore contain à priori the determination of the unity of this manifold."
     "It follows that such a proof must demonstrate the possibility of arriving, synthetically and à priori, at a certain knowledge of things, which was not contained in our conceptions of these things."
     "Now the most general relations which can exist in our representations are: 1st, the relation to the subject; 2nd, the relation to objects, either as phenomena, or as objects of thought in general."
     "This demonstration, moreover, has the merit of setting the understanding at liberty to conceive this distinction in a different manner, if the explanation of the fact requires any such hypothesis."
     "This twofold manner of cogitating a power residing in a sensuous object does not run counter to any of the conceptions which we ought to form of the world of phenomena or of a possible experience."
     "But in most cases they differ from each other toto caelo, and I can by no means conclude that, because a thing is in itself possible, it is also possible in all relations, and therefore absolutely."
     "For it is the conception of quantities only that is capable of being constructed, that is, presented à priori in intuition; while qualities cannot be given in any other than an empirical intuition."
     "If we wish to set one of these two apart from the other — space from phenomena — there arise all sorts of empty determinations of external intuition, which are very far from being possible perceptions."
     "After this proof of the viciousness of the argument commonly employed in maintaining cosmological assertions, both parties may now be justly dismissed, as advancing claims without grounds or title."
     "But an thought must directly, or indirectly, by means of certain signs, relate ultimately to intuitions; consequently, with us, to sensibility, because in no other way can an object be given to us."
     "For this would be, not an immanent, but a transcendent use of moral theology, and, like the transcendent use of mere speculation, would inevitably pervert and frustrate the ultimate ends of reason."
     "Hence it is evident that these logical criteria of the possibility of cognition are merely the three categories of quantity modified and transformed to suit an unauthorized manner of applying them."
     "I cannot even make the assumption — as the practical interests of morality require — of God, freedom, and immortality, if I do not deprive speculative reason of its pretensions to transcendent insight."
     "If this be demurred to, it matters not; I will then limit my assertion to pure mathematics, the very conception of which implies that it consists of knowledge altogether non-empirical and à priori."
     "In one word, the causality of the subject, in so far as it is intelligible, would not form part of the series of empirical conditions which determine and necessitate an event in the world of sense."
     "In other words, reason does not assure us of the objective validity of the conception; it merely gives us the idea of something, on which the supreme and necessary unity of all experience is based."
     "In whatsoever mode, or by whatsoever means, our knowledge may relate to objects, it is at least quite clear that the only manner in which it immediately relates to them is by means of an intuition."
     "It follows that I cognize myself, not through my being conscious of myself as thinking, but only when I am conscious of the intuition of myself as determined in relation to the function of thought."
     "It is a purely logical principle, itself based upon the principle of contradiction; inasmuch as it makes complete abstraction of the content and attends merely to the logical form of the cognition."
     "Now this completeness of a science cannot be accepted with confidence on the guarantee of a mere estimate of its existence in an aggregate formed only by means of repeated experiments and attempts."
     "Now, from the fact that the dynamical ideas admit a condition of phenomena which does not form a part of the series of phenomena, arises a result which we should not have expected from an antinomy."
     "The apodeictical proposition cogitates the assertorical as determined by these very laws of the understanding, consequently as affirming à priori, and in this manner it expresses logical necessity."
     "The hypothesis of a supreme intelligence, as the sole cause of the universe — an intelligence which has for us no more than an ideal existence — is accordingly always of the greatest service to reason."
     "The understanding may be a faculty for the production of unity of phenomena by virtue of rules; the reason is a faculty for the production of unity of rules (of the understanding) under principles."
     "Thus, one person may cogitate in his conception of gold, in addition to its properties of weight, colour, malleability, that of resisting rust, while another person may be ignorant of this quality."
     "To all empirical cognition belongs the synthesis of the manifold by the imagination, a synthesis which is always successive, that is, in which the representations therein always follow one another."
     "Today, he would feel convinced that the human will is free; to-morrow, considering the indissoluble chain of nature, he would look on freedom as a mere illusion and declare nature to be all-in-all."
     "We shall at present defer this radical inquiry and, in the meantime, consider for a little what side in the controversy we should most willingly take, if we were obliged to become partisans at all."
     "Consequently it is absolutely necessary that all substances in the world of phenomena, in so far as they are coexistent, stand in a relation of complete community of reciprocal action to each other."
     "As pure logic, it has no empirical principles, and consequently draws nothing (contrary to the common persuasion) from psychology, which therefore has no influence on the canon of the understanding."
     "As to metaphysics, even if we look upon it merely as an attempted science, yet, from the nature of human reason, an indispensable one, we find that it must contain synthetical propositions à priori."
     "Each must try to establish his assertions by a transcendental deduction of the grounds of proof employed in his argument, and thus enable us to see in what way the claims of reason may be supported."
     "I apply the term transcendental to all knowledge which is not so much occupied with objects as with the mode of our cognition of these objects, so far as this mode of cognition is possible à priori."
     "In both, the mode of proof is quite in accordance with the common procedure of human reason, which often falls into discord with itself, from considering an object from two different points of view."
     "In this view, the theoretical employment of reason is that by which I cognize à priori (as necessary) that something is, while the practical is that by which I cognize à priori what ought to happen."
     "So far, then, it is a mere idea — though still a practical idea — which may have, and ought to have, an influence on the world of sense, so as to bring it as far as possible into conformity with itself."
     "That this antinomy is based upon a mere illusion, and that nature and freedom are at least not opposed — this was the only thing in our power to prove, and the question which it was our task to solve."
     "The brilliant claims of reason striving to extend its dominion beyond the limits of experience, have been represented above only in dry formulae, which contain merely the grounds of its pretensions."
     "The former cognition of our ignorance, which is possible only on a rational basis, is a science; the latter is merely a perception, and we cannot say how far the inferences drawn from it may extend."
     "The notion of a Supreme Being is in many respects a highly useful idea; but for the very reason that it is an idea, it is incapable of enlarging our cognition with regard to the existence of things."
     "The regress does not, therefore, proceed to infinity (an infinity given), but only to an indefinite extent, for or the of presenting to us a quantity — realized only in and through the regress itself."
     "Those thinkers who aim at distinguishing philosophy from mathematics by asserting that the former has to do with quality merely, and the latter with quantity, have mistaken the effect for the cause."
     "We have already seen that we are in possession of two perfectly different kinds of conceptions, which nevertheless agree with each other in this, that they both apply to objects completely à priori."
     "We must seek the cause of our failure in our idea itself, which is an insoluble problem and in regard to which we obstinately assume that there exists a real object corresponding and adequate to it."
     "But if we cogitate existence by the pure category alone, it is not to be wondered at, that we should find ourselves unable to present any criterion sufficient to distinguish it from mere possibility."
     "But truth depends upon agreement with the object, and consequently the judgements of all understandings, if true, must be in agreement with each other (consentientia uni tertio consentiunt inter se)."
     "For all hoping has happiness for its object and stands in precisely the same relation to the practical and the law of morality as knowing to the theoretical cognition of things and the law of nature."
     "For the existence of phenomena, always conditioned and never self-subsistent, requires us to look for an object different from phenomena — an intelligible object, with which all contingency must cease."
     "Hence it follows that consciousness in time is necessarily connected also with the existence of things without me, inasmuch as the existence of these things is the condition of determination in time."
     "Hence we are not entitled to regard them as accidental and derived from the mere will of the ruler, especially as we have no conception of such a will, except as formed in accordance with these laws."
     "And now we can clearly perceive the result of our transcendental dialectic, and the proper aim of the ideas of pure reason — which become dialectical solely from misunderstanding and inconsiderateness."
     "But pure conceptions of the understanding, when compared with empirical intuitions, or even with sensuous intuitions in general, are quite heterogeneous, and never can be discovered in any intuition."
     "Hitherto this fact, though incontestably true and very important in its consequences, seems to have escaped the analysts of the human mind, nay, to be in complete opposition to all their conjectures."
     "Holding for true, or the subjective validity of a judgement in relation to conviction (which is, at the same time, objectively valid), has the three following degrees: opinion, belief, and knowledge."
     "I cogitate therein only the successive progress from one moment to another, and hence, by means of the different portions of time and the addition of them, a determinate quantity of time is produced."
     "Imagination may be allowed, under the strict surveillance of reason, to invent suppositions; but, these must be based on something that is perfectly certain — and that is the possibility of the object."
     "It is not merely the duty of metaphysics to dissect, and thereby analytically to illustrate the conceptions which we form à priori of things; but we seek to widen the range of our à priori knowledge."
     "The Leibnitzian monadology has really no better foundation than on this philosopher’s mode of falsely representing the difference of the internal and external solely in relation to the understanding."
     "The estimate of our rational cognition /à priori/ at which we arrive is that it has only to do with phenomena, and that things in themselves, while possessing a real existence, lie beyond its sphere."
     "The first is based upon empirical principles; for it is only by experience that I can learn either what inclinations exist which desire satisfaction, or what are the natural means of satisfying them."
     "The transition from the non-being of a state into the existence of it, supposing that this state contains no quality which previously existed in the phenomenon, is a fact of itself demanding inquiry."
     "They may produce a volition, which, so far from being necessary, is always conditioned — a volition to which the ought enunciated by reason, sets an aim and a standard, gives permission or prohibition."
     "This does not signify a doctrine of probability; for probability is truth, only cognized upon insufficient grounds, and though the information it gives us is imperfect, it is not therefore deceitful."
     "But as this is the case with all synthesis of apprehension, as I have shown above in the example of a house, my apprehension of an event is not yet sufficiently distinguished from other apprehensions."
     "But at the moment when the effect first arises, it is always simultaneous with the causality of its cause, because, if the cause had but a moment before ceased to be, the effect could not have arisen."
     "But it at the same time prescribes limits to itself, for it confesses itself unable to cognize these by means of the categories, and hence is compelled to cogitate them merely as an unknown something."
     "For, when we have made abstraction of all the conditions of intuition, there certainly remains in the mere conception nothing but the internal in general, through which alone the external is possible."
     "Had he done so, he would have found, to take one example among many, that the principle of permanence was of this character, and that it, as well as the principle of causality, anticipates experience."
     "The dialectical illusion in rational psychology arises from our confounding an idea of reason (of a pure intelligence) with the conception — in every respect undetermined — of a thinking being in general."
     "The former of these statements will not bold good with respect to the categories (nor in regard to pure sensuous intuition), for they are à priori conceptions, and therefore independent of experience."
     "The latter results from the union of the two former, inasmuch as we regard the systematic connection as complete in thought, in the ascent to higher genera, as well as in the descent to lower species."
     "The one concluded: the moon revolves on its own axis, because it constantly presents the same side to the earth; the other declared that the moon does not revolve on its own axis, for the same reason."
     "The second sort of combination (nexus) is the synthesis of a manifold, in so far as its parts do belong necessarily to each other; for example, the accident to a substance, or the effect to the cause."
     "This attempted physiological derivation, which cannot properly be called deduction, because it relates merely to a quaestio facti, I shall entitle an explanation of the possession of a pure cognition."
     "This, again, may be divided into the physical synthesis, of the phenomena divided among each other, and the metaphysical synthesis, or the connection of phenomena à priori in the faculty of cognition."
     "Time was, when she was the /queen/ of all the sciences; and, if we take the will for the deed, she certainly deserves, so far as regards the high importance of her object-matter, this title of honour."
     "Unconditioned necessity, which, as the ultimate support and stay of all existing things, is an indispensable requirement of the mind, is an abyss on the verge of which human reason trembles in dismay."
     "Whatever is grounded in the nature of our powers will be found to be in harmony with the final purpose and proper employment of these powers, when once we have discovered their true direction and aim."
     "When, therefore, to the conception of a thing an à priori determination is synthetically added, such a proposition must obtain, if not a proof, at least a deduction of the legitimacy of its assertion."
     "All that we do, and ought to do, is to follow out the physico-mechanical connection in nature according to general laws, with the hope of discovering, sooner or later, the teleological connection also."
     "As, therefore, an absolutely simple object cannot be given in any experience, and the world of sense must be considered as the sum total of all possible experiences: nothing simple exists in the world."
     "For a question regarding the constitution of a something which cannot be cogitated by any determined predicate, being completely beyond the sphere of objects and experience, is perfectly null and void."
     "For experience contains, in addition to the thought of something existing, intuition, and in this case it must be internal intuition, that is, time, in relation to which the subject must be determined."
     "I shall therefore begin with an examination of the transcendental argument, and afterwards inquire what additional strength has accrued to this mode of proof from the addition of the empirical element."
     "If, however, the general is admitted as problematical only, and is a mere idea, the particular case is certain, but the universality of the rule which applies to this particular case remains a problem."
     "And for this reason, in respect to the form of phenomena, much may be said à priori, whilst of the thing in itself, which may lie at the foundation of these phenomena, it is impossible to say anything."
     "And so we may correctly say that space contains all which can appear to us externally, but not all things considered as things in themselves, be they intuited or not, or by whatsoever subject one will."
     "But the à priori conditions of intuition are in relation to a possible experience absolutely necessary, those of the existence of objects of a possible empirical intuition are in themselves contingent."
     "But, it will be asked again, can we on these grounds, admit the existence of a wise and omnipotent author of the world? Without doubt; and not only so, but we must assume the existence of such a being."
     "First, that the world has no beginning — in this case it is too large for our conception; for this conception, which consists in a successive regress, cannot overtake the whole eternity that has elapsed."
     "For example, this universal identity of the apperception of the manifold given in intuition contains a synthesis of representations and is possible only by means of the consciousness of this synthesis."
     "From what has been said, it follows that a causality must be admitted, by means of which something happens, without its cause being determined according to necessary laws by some other cause preceding."
     "In recent times the hope dawned upon us of seeing those disputes settled, and the legitimacy of her claims established by a kind of /physiology/ of the human understanding — that of the celebrated Locke."
     "That in a figure which is bounded by three straight lines there are three angles, is an immediate cognition; but that these angles are together equal to two right angles, is an inference or conclusion."
     "The consciousness of self is thus very far from a knowledge of self, in which I do not use the categories, whereby I cogitate an object, by means of the conjunction of the manifold in one apperception."
     "The embarrassments into which a reason, which postulates the unconditioned, necessarily falls, must, therefore, continue to exist; or the unconditioned must be placed in the sphere of the intelligible."
     "The reader must be careful to remark that my intention in the above remarks has not been to prove the actual existence of freedom, as a faculty in which resides the cause of certain sensuous phenomena."
     "The strict universality of this law never can be a characteristic of empirical laws, which obtain through induction only a comparative universality, that is, an extended range of practical application."
     "They are therefore really existent, if they stand in empirical connection with my actual or real consciousness, although they are not in themselves real, that is, apart from the progress of experience."
     "They serve, however, like identical propositions, as links in the chain of method, not as principles — for example, a = a, the whole is equal to itself, or (a+b)  — > a, the whole is greater than its part."
     "This employment of reason is merely regulative, and its sole aim is the introduction of unity into the aggregate of our particular cognitions, and thereby the approximating of the rule to universality."
     "Transcendental reason, therefore, presents us with no other criterion than that of an attempt to reconcile such assertions, and for this purpose to permit a free and unrestrained conflict between them."
     "And thus reason is satisfied, and an unconditioned placed at the head of the series of phenomena, without introducing confusion into or discontinuing it, contrary to the principles of the understanding."
     "But it can receive its determined place in time only by the presupposition that something existed in the foregoing state, upon which it follows inevitably and always, that is, in conformity with a rule."
     "He compared all things with each other merely by means of conceptions, and naturally found no other differences than those by which the understanding distinguishes its pure conceptions one from another."
     "If, then, it is always conditioned, it is never completely or as a whole; and it is, therefore, not an unconditioned whole and does not exist as such, either with an infinite, or with a finite quantity."
     "Consequently time, in which all changes of phenomena must be cogitated, remains and changes not, because it is that in which succession and coexistence can be represented only as determinations thereof."
     "Hence a possible empirical conception must be the standard by which we are to judge whether an idea is anything more than an idea and fiction of thought, or whether it relates to an object in the world."
     "If we review our cognitions in their entire extent, we shall find that the peculiar business of reason is to arrange them into a system, that is to say, to give them connection according to a principle."
     "If, secondly, the question is asked whether this being is substance, whether it is of the greatest reality, whether it is necessary, and so forth? I answer that this question is utterly without meaning."
     "In this case, the synthesis of the conditioned with its condition, is a synthesis of the understanding merely, which represents things as they are, without regarding whether and how we can cognize them."
     "Just in the same way did Plato, abandoning the world of sense because of the narrow limits it sets to the understanding, venture upon the wings of ideas beyond it, into the void space of pure intellect."
     "Now that which conjoins the manifold of sensuous intuition is imagination, a mental act to which understanding contributes unity of intellectual synthesis, and sensibility, manifoldness of apprehension."
     "Our present purpose is to avail ourselves of this series of states or conditions as a guide to an existence which may be the highest condition of all changeable phenomena, that is, to a necessary being."
     "Principles à priori are so called, not merely because they contain in themselves the grounds of other judgements, but also because they themselves are not grounded in higher and more general cognitions."
     "Still it is not to be supposed that it was as easy for this science to strike into, or rather to construct for itself, that royal road, as it was for logic, in which reason has only to deal with itself."
     "That, however, which is present in this or that place, or any operation going on, or result taking place in the things themselves, with the exception of change of place, is not given to us by intuition."
     "The consciousness of ignorance — unless this ignorance is recognized to be absolutely necessary ought, instead of forming the conclusion of my inquiries, to be the strongest motive to the pursuit of them."
     "The proposition of the identity of my Self amidst all the manifold representations of which I am conscious, is likewise a proposition lying in the conceptions themselves, and is consequently analytical."
     "We have said that in all these cases the cosmological idea is either too great or too small for the empirical regress in a synthesis, and consequently for every possible conception of the understanding."
     "We have, on the contrary, merely employed the three categories of quantity, setting aside their application to objects of experience, as general logical laws of the consistency of cognition with itself."
     "But hence arise many misconceptions, and it would be a more accurate and just mode of expression to designate the accident only as the mode in which the existence of a substance is positively determined."
     "For, as space is the form of that intuition which we call external, and, without objects in space, no empirical representation could be given us, we can and ought to regard extended bodies in it as real."
     "I am far from allowing any value to such chimeras; and the principles of our analytic have clearly proved that no other than an empirical use of the categories — that of substance, for example — is possible."
     "If the conceptions in our minds do not assist us to some certain result in regard to these problems, we must not defend ourselves on the plea that the object itself remains hidden from and unknown to us."
     "According to the physico-theological argument, the connection and harmony existing in the world evidence the contingency of the form merely, but not of the matter, that is, of the substance of the world."
     "For change does not affect time itself, but only the phenomena in time (just as coexistence cannot be regarded as a modus of time itself, seeing that in time no parts are coexistent, but all successive)."
     "For the fact that no cognition can be at variance with this principle without nullifying itself, constitutes this principle the sine qua non, but not the determining ground of the truth of our cognition."
     "Granted, then, that we must go out beyond a given conception, in order to compare it synthetically with another, a third thing is necessary, in which alone the synthesis of two conceptions can originate."
     "It is only the principles of reason which can give to concordant phenomena the validity of laws, and it is only when experiment is directed by these rational principles that it can have any real utility."
     "On the contrary, this idea serves merely to indicate a certain unattainable perfection, and rather limits the operations than, by the presentation of new objects, extends the sphere of the understanding."
     "The question of the possibility of freedom does indeed concern psychology; but, as it rests upon dialectical arguments of pure reason, its solution must engage the attention of transcendental philosophy."
     "Though my conception of a thing is in itself complete, I am still entitled to ask whether the object of it is merely possible, or whether it is also real, or, if the latter, whether it is also necessary."
     "I am warranted in assuming this, not only by the arguments of the most enlightened moralists, but by the moral judgement of every man who will make the attempt to form a distinct conception of such a law."
     "If then, we appeal merely to thought, we cannot discover the necessary condition of the application of the conception of substance — that is, of a subject existing per se — to the subject as a thinking being."
     "But the reader must remark that, in this the second division of our transcendental Critique the discipline of pure reason is not directed to the content, but to the method of the cognition of pure reason."
     "But, if they are exempted, they become the subjects of just suspicion, and cannot lay claim to sincere respect, which reason accords only to that which has stood the test of a free and public examination."
     "For in this manner, we not only facilitate our own labour, inasmuch as we define it clearly to ourselves, but also render it more easy for others to decide whether we have done justice to our undertaking."
     "It will, therefore, well repay our labours to consider for a little the course of reasoning which he followed and the errors into which he strayed, although setting out on the path of truth and certitude."
     "Of all mental notions, that of conjunction is the only one which cannot be given through objects, but can be originated only by the subject itself, because it is an act of its purely spontaneous activity."
     "The former regards the Supreme Being as the cause of the world — whether by the necessity of his nature, or as a free agent, is left undetermined; the latter considers this being as the author of the world."
     "The term principle is ambiguous, and commonly signifies merely a cognition that may be employed as a principle, although it is not in itself, and as regards its proper origin, entitled to the distinction."
     "Thus I may analyse the conception I have of gold; but I gain no new information from this analysis, I merely enumerate the different properties which I had connected with the notion indicated by the word."
     "Thus these principles conduct us to a unity in the genera of the forms of these orbits, and, proceeding farther, to a unity as regards the cause of the motions of the heavenly bodies — that is, gravitation."
     "We employ certain signs only so long as we require them for the sake of distinction; new observations abstract some and add new ones, so that an empirical conception never remains within permanent limits."
     "With this formal condition of sensibility, therefore, all phenomena necessarily correspond, because it is only through it that they can be phenomena at all; that is, can be empirically intuited and given."
     "At the same time, we may attribute to this being infinite perfection — a perfection which necessarily transcends that which our knowledge of the order and design in the world authorize us to predicate of it."
     "But if they had regarded matter, not relatively — as the substratum of phenomena, but absolutely and in itself — as an independent existence, this idea of absolute necessity would have immediately disappeared."
     "For I can never be sure, that the clear representation of a given conception (which is given in a confused state) has been fully developed, until I know that the representation is adequate with its object."
     "For reason placed it, as the conception of all reality, at the basis of the complete determination of things, without requiring that this conception be regarded as the conception of an objective existence."
     "From the inability of reason to establish this principle as a necessary law for the acquisition of all experience, he inferred the nullity of all the attempts of reason to pass the region of the empirical."
     "If this subjective community is to rest upon an objective basis, or to be applied to substances as phenomena, the perception of one substance must render possible the perception of another, and conversely."
     "At the same time it does not deprive the speculative philosopher of his just title to be the sole depositor of a science which benefits the public without its knowledge — I mean, the Critique of Pure Reason."
     "Hence it is as necessary for the mind to make its conceptions sensuous (that is, to join to them the object in intuition), as to make its intuitions intelligible (that is, to bring them under conceptions)."
     "In like manner, there is in the conception of a thing no contradiction when a negative is not connected with an affirmative; and merely affirmative conceptions cannot, in conjunction, produce any negation."
     "It is true, these questions have not been solved as dogmatism, in its vain fancies and desires, had expected; for it can only be satisfied by the exercise of magical arts, and of these I have no knowledge."
     "Moreover, the poverty of the usual arguments which go to prove the existence of a vast sphere of possibility, of which all that is real (every object of experience) is but a small part, is very remarkable."
     "Now morality does not require the speculative cognition of liberty; it is enough that I can think it, that its conception involves no contradiction, that it does not interfere with the mechanism of nature."
     "Opinions and probable judgements on the nature of things can only be employed to explain given phenomena, or they may relate to the effect, in accordance with empirical laws, of an actually existing cause."
     "Substance in space we are cognizant of only through forces operative in it, either drawing others towards itself (attraction), or preventing others from forcing into itself (repulsion and impenetrability)."
     "That something happens, that is to say, that something or some state exists which before was not, cannot be empirically perceived, unless a phenomenon precedes, which does not contain in itself this state."
     "The formal and logical procedure of reason in syllogisms gives us sufficient information in regard to the ground on which the transcendental principle of reason in its pure synthetical cognition will rest."
     "The philosophers of antiquity regarded all the forms of nature as contingent; while matter was considered by them, in accordance with the judgement of the common reason of mankind, as primal and necessary."
     "This argument, although in fact transcendental, inasmuch as it rests upon the intrinsic insufficiency of the contingent, is so simple and natural, that the commonest understanding can appreciate its value."
     "Thus, in the conception of a figure which is contained within two straight lines, there is no contradiction, for the conceptions of two straight lines and of their junction contain no negation of a figure."
     "Thus, the conception of a number (which belongs to the category of totality) is not always possible, where the conceptions of multitude and unity exist (for example, in the representation of the infinite)."
     "To be that, it is necessary that, in the same time in which the preceding state existed, its opposite could have existed in its place; but such a cognition is not given us in the mere phenomenon of change."
     "We might, indeed at first suppose that the proposition 7 + 5 = 12 is a merely analytical proposition, following (according to the principle of contradiction) from the conception of a sum of seven and five."
     "But how objects as things in themselves — how the nature of things is subordinated to principles and is to be determined, according to conceptions, is a question which it seems well nigh impossible to answer."
     "For what is demanded is not only this full and complete intuition, but also a complete synthesis and the consciousness of its absolute totality; and this is not possible by means of any empirical cognition."
     "I can consider a given point of time in relation to past time only as conditioned, because this given moment comes into existence only through the past time rather through the passing of the preceding time."
     "All relations of thought in judgements are those (a) of the predicate to the subject; (b) of the principle to its consequence; (c) of the divided cognition and all the members of the division to each other."
     "I cannot represent to myself any line, however small, without drawing it in thought, that is, without generating from a point all its parts one after another, and in this way alone producing this intuition."
     "If we wish to divide this science from the universal point of view of a science in general, it ought to comprehend, first, a Doctrine of the Elements, and, secondly, a Doctrine of the Method of pure reason."
     "Now, as this problem relates to our in reference to the highest aim of humanity, it is evident that the ultimate intention of nature, in the constitution of our reason, has been directed to the moral alone."
     "On the contrary, it is plain that /the hope of a future life/ arises from the feeling, which exists in the breast of every man, that the temporal is inadequate to meet and satisfy the demands of his nature."
     "Reason requires this according to the principle: If the conditioned is given the whole of the conditions, and consequently the absolutely unconditioned, is also given, whereby alone the former was possible."
     "The practice or execution of the idea is always limited and defective, but nevertheless within indeterminable boundaries, consequently always under the influence of the conception of an absolute perfection."
     "This important change in the field of the sciences, this loss of its fancied possessions, to which speculative reason must submit, does not prove in any way detrimental to the general interests of humanity."
     "This is of course very easy; as the same arguments which demonstrated the inability of human reason to affirm the existence of a Supreme Being must be alike sufficient to prove the invalidity of its denial."
     "This principle of reason is hence valid only as a rule for the extension of a possible experience — its invalidity as a principle constitutive of phenomena in themselves having been sufficiently demonstrated."
     "Thus the categories do in some measure really extend further than sensuous intuition, inasmuch as they think objects in general, without regard to the mode (of sensibility) in which these objects are given."
     "We begin by hypostatizing the principle of systematic unity, and by giving an anthropomorphic determination to the conception of a Supreme Intelligence, and then proceed forcibly to impose aims upon nature."
     "An à priori or non-empirical conception contains either a pure intuition — and in this case it can be constructed; or it contains nothing but the synthesis of possible intuitions, which are not given à priori."
     "As, therefore, neither empirical nor à priori conceptions are capable of definition, we have to see whether the only other kind of conceptions — arbitrary conceptions — can be subjected to this mental operation."
     "But for what reason the intelligible character generates such and such phenomena and exhibits such and such an empirical character under certain circumstances, it is beyond the power of our reason to decide."
     "But this is a reciprocal influence, that is to say, a real community (commercium) of substances, without which therefore the empirical relation of coexistence would be a notion beyond the reach of our minds."
     "But when you say, God does not exist, neither omnipotence nor any other predicate is affirmed; they must all disappear with the subject, and in this judgement there cannot exist the least self-contradiction."
     "Every conception may be regarded as a point, which, as the standpoint of a spectator, has a certain horizon, which may be said to enclose a number of things that may be viewed, so to speak, from that centre."
     "For all the categories which aid me in forming a conception of an object cannot be employed except in the world of sense, and are without meaning when not applied to objects of actual or possible experience."
     "For external intuition contains in itself à priori formal external relations, as the conditions of the possibility of the real relations of action and reaction, and therefore of the possibility of community."
     "Hence also the moral laws are universally regarded as commands, which they could not be did they not connect à priori adequate consequences with their dictates, and thus carry with them promises and threats."
     "But again, everything, as regards its possibility, is also subject to the principle of complete determination, according to which one of all the possible contradictory predicates of things must belong to it."
     "But in the Critique itself it will be demonstrated, not hypothetically, but apodeictically, from the nature of our representations of space and time, and from the elementary conceptions of the understanding."
     "But this principle is not to be regarded as a principle for every possible understanding, but only for the understanding by means of whose pure apperception in the thought I am, no manifold content is given."
     "He would say, in answer to the sophistical arguments of the opposite party: If you do not accept a mathematical first, in relation to time, you have no need to seek a dynamical first, in regard to causality."
     "In transcendental logic we isolate the understanding (as in transcendental æsthetic the sensibility) and select from our cognition merely that part of thought which has its origin in the understanding alone."
     "Pure reason, however, when engaged in the sphere of dogmatism, is not so thoroughly conscious of a strict observance of its highest laws, as to appear before a higher judicial reason with perfect confidence."
     "So high a value do we set upon these investigations, that even at the risk of error, we persist in following them out, and permit neither doubt nor disregard nor indifference to restrain us from the pursuit."
     "That natural dispositions and talents (such as imagination and wit), which ask a free and unlimited development, require in many respects the corrective influence of discipline, every one will readily grant."
     "The proofs which have been current among men, preserve their value undiminished; nay, rather gain in clearness and unsophisticated power, by the rejection of the dogmatical assumptions of speculative reason."
     "The proposition, God is omnipotent, contains two conceptions, which have a certain object or content; the word is, is no additional predicate — it merely indicates the relation of the predicate to the subject."
     "This conception must be regarded as in some degree satisfactory, if we admit the existence of a necessary being, and consider that there exists a necessity for a definite and final answer to these questions."
     "Accordingly we think something in general and determine it on the one hand sensuously, but, on the other, distinguish the general and in abstracto represented object from this particular mode of intuiting it."
     "For the very conception which enables us to raise the question must give us the power of answering it; inasmuch as the object, as in the case of right and wrong, is not to be discovered out of the conception."
     "If they are principles of the understanding, it is vain to expect that we should attain by their means to ideas of pure reason; for these principles are valid only in regard to objects of possible experience."
     "How a thing can be changed, how it is possible that upon one state existing in one point of time, an opposite state should follow in another point of time — of this we have not the smallest conception à priori."
     "In the first place, it is evident that both present us, with very many apodeictic and synthetic propositions à priori, but especially space — and for this reason we shall prefer it for investigation at present."
     "Instead of any such attempt, I confine myself to the examination of reason alone and its pure thought; and I do not need to seek far for the sum-total of its cognition, because it has its seat in my own mind."
     "It does not form conceptions of objects, it merely arranges them and gives to them that unity which they are capable of possessing when the sphere of their application has been extended as widely as possible."
     "It is sufficient, at present, to remark that, as the complete and unbroken connection of phenomena is an unalterable law of nature, freedom is impossible — on the supposition that phenomena are absolutely real."
     "The conceptions of reality, substance, causality, nay, even that of necessity in existence, have no significance out of the sphere of empirical cognition, and cannot, beyond that sphere, determine any object."
     "Essential simplicity (with the other attributes predicated of the ego) is regarded as the mere schema of this regulative principle; it is not assumed that it is the actual ground of the properties of the soul."
     "For example, motion or rest of the world in an infinite empty space, or a determination of the mutual relation of both, cannot possibly be perceived, and is therefore merely the predicate of a notional entity."
     "For our reason is, subjectively considered, itself a system, and, in the sphere of mere conceptions, a system of investigation according to principles of unity, the material being supplied by experience alone."
     "For the principles of reason, if employed as objective, are without exception dialectical and possess no validity or truth, except as regulative principles of the systematic employment of reason in experience."
     "I should not hesitate to stake my all on the truth of the proposition — if there were any possibility of bringing it to the test of experience — that, at least, some one of the planets, which we see, is inhabited."
     "If I find such a condition, and if the object mentioned in the conclusion can be subsumed under the given condition, then this conclusion follows from a rule which is also valid for other objects of cognition."
     "And accordingly we find existing in the mind à priori, the pure form of sensuous intuitions in general, in which all the manifold content of the phenomenal world is arranged and viewed under certain relations."
     "But from the two great ends to the attainment of which all these efforts of pure reason were in fact directed, we remain just as far removed as if we had consulted our ease and declined the task at the outset."
     "For the said rules or criteria are, in respect to their chief sources, merely empirical, consequently never can serve as determinate laws à priori, by which our judgement in matters of taste is to be directed."
     "In other words, I can never complete the regress through the conditions of existence, without admitting the existence of a necessary being; but, on the other hand, I cannot make a commencement from this being."
     "Mathematics, on the other hand, may possess axioms, because it can always connect the predicates of an object à priori, and without any mediating term, by means of the construction of conceptions in intuition."
     "No one can find an intuition which shall correspond to the conception of reality, except in experience; it cannot be presented to the mind à priori and antecedently to the empirical consciousness of a reality."
     "Now as every general cognition may serve as the major in a syllogism, and the understanding presents us with such general à priori propositions, they may be termed principles, in respect of their possible use."
     "Now, as such an intuition, that is, an intellectual intuition, is no part of our faculty of cognition, it is absolutely impossible for the categories to possess any application beyond the limits of experience."
     "On the other hand, we deny to time all claim to absolute reality; that is, we deny that it, without having regard to the form of our sensuous intuition, absolutely inheres in things as a condition or property."
     "On the other hand, we understand by nature, substantive (materialiter), the sum total of phenomena, in so far as they, by virtue of an internal principle of causality, are connected with each other throughout."
     "That is, we must cogitate it only as an unknown substratum of the systematic unity, order, and finality of the world — a unity which reason must employ as the regulative principle of its investigation of nature."
     "That which is never to be found in the object itself, but always in the relation of the object to the subject, and which moreover is inseparable from our representation of the object, we denominate phenomenon."
     "These are just threefold — analogously with all judgements, in so far as they differ in the mode of expressing the relation of a cognition in the understanding — namely, categorical, hypothetical, and disjunctive."
     "This schematism of our understanding in regard to phenomena and their mere form, is an art, hidden in the depths of the human soul, whose true modes of action we shall only with difficulty discover and unveil."
     "But the transcendental object, which is the foundation of the phenomenon which we call matter, is a mere nescio quid, the nature of which we could not understand, even though someone were found able to tell us."
     "For they originate in the nature of reason itself, and it is impossible that this supreme tribunal for all the rights and claims of speculation should be itself undeserving of confidence and promotive of error."
     "All mathematical conceptions, therefore, are not per se cognition, except in so far as we presuppose that there exist things which can only be represented conformably to the form of our pure sensuous intuition."
     "Consequently apprehension in such an event, and the event itself, as far as regards the possibility of its perception, stands under the conception of the relation of cause and effect: and so in all other cases."
     "In the latter case, as an order or determination inherent in things themselves, it could not be antecedent to things, as their condition, nor discerned or intuited by means of synthetical propositions à priori."
     "In this /second edition/, I have endeavoured, as far as possible, to remove the difficulties and obscurity which, without fault of mine perhaps, have given rise to many misconceptions even among acute thinkers."
     "In this case, we should have had at an earlier period a matured and profound criticism, which must have put an end to all dialectical disputes, by exposing the illusions and prejudices in which they originated."
     "It may be considered to be intelligible, as regards its action — the action of a thing which is a thing in itself, and sensuous, as regards its effects — the effects of a phenomenon belonging to the sensuous world."
     "It then seeks the conception of that which is independent of all conditions, and finds it in that which is itself the sufficient condition of all other things — in other words, in that which contains all reality."
     "Lastly, the objective possibility of the category of community cannot be conceived by mere reason, and consequently its objective reality cannot be demonstrated without an intuition, and that external in space."
     "Now what is this tertium quid that is to be the medium of all synthetical judgements? It is only a complex in which all our representations are contained, the internal sense to wit, and its form à priori, time."
     "Now, I may admit the existence of an incomprehensible being of this nature — the object of a mere idea, relatively to the world of sense; although I have no ground to admit its existence absolutely and in itself."
     "Now, as all our intuition is sensuous, imagination, by reason of the subjective condition under which alone it can give a corresponding intuition to the conceptions of the understanding, belongs to sensibility."
     "On the other hand, it is sufficient, absolutely and for every one, if I know for certain that no one can be acquainted with any other conditions under which the attainment of the proposed end would be possible."
     "On the other hand, there must be in physical science an infinite number of conjectures, which can never become certainties; because the phenomena of nature are not given as objects dependent on our conceptions."
     "Only so much seems necessary, by way of introduction of premonition, that there are two sources of human knowledge (which probably spring from a common, but to us unknown root), namely, sense and understanding."
     "The proper signification of the word monas (as employed by Leibnitz) ought to relate to the simple, given immediately as simple substance (for example, in consciousness), and not as an element of the composite."
     "This freedom will, among other things, permit of our openly stating the difficulties and doubts which we are ourselves unable to solve, without being decried on that account as turbulent and dangerous citizens."
     "Though supplied with these, and putting ourselves under their guidance, we can make no teleological use of the knowledge of nature, as regards cognition, unless nature itself has established teleological unity."
     "But in the former case the composite could not itself consist of substances, because with substances composition is merely a contingent relation, apart from which they must still exist as self-subsistent beings."
     "For every one of its real properties, being derived, must be only conditionally necessary, and can therefore be annihilated in thought; and thus the whole existence of matter can be so annihilated or suppressed."
     "For if I lay the ball upon the cushion, then the hollow follows upon the before smooth surface; but supposing the cushion has, from some cause or another, a hollow, there does not thereupon follow a leaden ball."
     "For in that case, we should lose altogether that which alone can represent the unity of time, to wit, the identity of the substratum, as that through which alone all change possesses complete and thorough unity."
     "For the fact that the conception of it precedes the perception, merely indicates the possibility of its existence; it is perception which presents matter to the conception, that is the sole criterion of reality."
     "If, then, there is any proper mode of employing the faculty of pure reason — in which case there must be a canon for this faculty — this canon will relate, not to the speculative, but to the practical use of reason."
     "All evasions, such as the statement that objects of sense do not conform to the rules of construction in space (for example, to the rule of the infinite divisibility of lines or angles), must fall to the ground."
     "And this foundation is itself unworthy of trust, if it leave under and above it empty space, if it do not fill all, and leave no room for a why or a wherefore, if it be not, in one word, infinite in its reality."
     "Arrived at this point, all sorts of excuses are sought after, in order to console us for its want of stability, or rather, indeed, to enable Us to dispense altogether with so late and dangerous an investigation."
     "But, when I say they existed prior to my experience, this means only that I must begin with the perception present to me and follow the track indicated until I discover them in some part or region of experience."
     "He maintained, for example, that God (who was probably nothing more, in his view, than the world) is neither finite nor infinite, neither in motion nor in rest, neither similar nor dissimilar to any other thing."
     "If, by the term noumenon, we understand a thing so far as it is not an object of our sensuous intuition, thus making abstraction of our mode of intuiting it, this is a noumenon in the negative sense of the word."
     "In carrying out the plan which the Critique prescribes, that is, in the future system of metaphysics, we must have recourse to the strict method of the celebrated WOLF, the greatest of all dogmatic philosophers."
     "In the explanation of given phenomena, no other things and no other grounds of explanation can be employed than those which stand in connection with the given phenomena according to the known laws of experience."
     "In the former case, I should have an empirical proposition (arrived at by actual measurement of the angles of the triangle), which would possess neither universality nor necessity; but that would be of no value."
     "Now let us suppose, for a moment, that we had not undertaken this criticism and, accordingly, had not drawn the necessary distinction between things as objects of experience and things as they are in themselves."
     "The categories are not based, as regards their origin, upon sensibility, like the forms of intuition, space, and time; they seem, therefore, to be capable of an application beyond the sphere of sensuous objects."
     "The principles of the pure understanding, which we have already propounded, ought to be of empirical and not of transcendental use, that is, they are not applicable to any object beyond the sphere of experience."
     "This attempt to introduce a complete revolution in the procedure of metaphysics, after the /example/ of the geometricians and natural philosophers, constitutes the aim of the Critique of Pure Speculative Reason."
     "This distinction will at once demonstrate the falsehood of the constitutive principle, and prevent us from attributing (by a transcendental subreptio) objective reality to an idea, which is valid only as a rule."
     "Thus, without a God and without a world, invisible to us now, but hoped for, the glorious ideas of morality are, indeed, objects of approbation and of admiration, but cannot be the springs of purpose and action."
     "We shall therefore follow with a critical eye this proposition through all the predicaments of pure psychology; but we shall, for brevity’s sake, allow this examination to proceed in an uninterrupted connection."
     "With regard to phenomena in general, we cannot think away time from them, and represent them to ourselves as out of and unconnected with time, but we can quite well represent to ourselves time void of phenomena."
     "And, at last, all speculative interests disappear before the practical interests which it holds dear; and it fancies that it understands and knows what its necessities and hopes incite it to assume or to believe."
     "As regards the order in which we must discuss those arguments, it will be exactly the reverse of that in which reason, in the progress of its development, attains to them — the order in which they are placed above."
     "But this world must be conceived only as an intelligible world, inasmuch as abstraction is therein made of all conditions (ends), and even of all impediments to morality (the weakness or pravity of human nature)."
     "But, in general, the uprightness of the defence stands in an inverse ratio to the goodness of the cause; and perhaps more honesty and fairness are shown by those who deny than by those who uphold these doctrines."
     "For if the condition of every conditioned — as regards its existence — is sensuous, and for this reason a part of the same series, it must be itself conditioned, as was shown in the antithesis of the fourth antinomy."
     "For in such a case reason does not demand absolute totality in the series, because it does not presuppose it as a condition and as given (datum), but merely as conditioned, and as capable of being given (dabile)."
     "For such a hypothesis would introduce the principle of ignava ratio, which requires us to give up the search for causes that might be discovered in the course of experience and to rest satisfied with a mere idea."
     "As impartial umpires, we must lay aside entirely the consideration whether the combatants are fighting for the right or for the wrong side, for the true or for the false, and allow the combat to be first decided."
     "But although it is admitted that the only possible deduction of pure à priori cognition is a transcendental deduction, it is not, for that reason, perfectly manifest that such a deduction is absolutely necessary."
     "He would have been peculiarly well fitted to give a truly scientific character to metaphysical studies, had it occurred to him to prepare the field by a criticism of the /organum/, that is, of pure reason itself."
     "That this famous argument is a mere paralogism, will be plain to any one who will consider the general remark which precedes our exposition of the principles of the pure understanding, and the section on noumena."
     "The assertor of the all-sufficiency of nature in regard to causality (transcendental Physiocracy), in opposition to the doctrine of freedom, would defend his view of the question somewhat in the following manner."
     "The function of reason in arguments consists in the universality of a cognition according to conceptions, and the syllogism itself is a judgement which is determined à priori in the whole extent of its condition."
     "The great protuberance of the earth under the Equator serves to overbalance the impetus of all other masses of earth, and thus to preserve the axis of the earth, so far as we can observe, in its present position."
     "The latter has, indeed, this advantage, that the representations of space and time do not come in their way when they wish to judge of objects, not as phenomena, but merely in their relation to the understanding."
     "The pure conceptions of the understanding are free from this limitation, and extend to objects of intuition in general, be the intuition like or unlike to ours, provided only it be sensuous, and not intellectual."
     "This is the only possible ground of proof; for our conception of an event possesses objective validity, that is, is a true conception, only because the law of causality determines an object to which it can refer."
     "Time is therefore merely a subjective condition of our (human) intuition (which is always sensuous, that is, so far as we are affected by objects), and in itself, independently of the mind or subject, is nothing."
     "But we must take care to confine them to this function, and guard against any assumption on their part of absolute validity, a proceeding which would involve reason in inextricable difficulties and contradictions."
     "By mere conceptions I cannot think anything external, without, at the same time, thinking something internal, for the reason that conceptions of relations presuppose given things, and without these are impossible."
     "An analogy of experience is therefore only a rule according to which unity of experience must arise out of perceptions in respect to objects (phenomena) not as a constitutive, but merely as a regulative principle."
     "In one word, this transcendental thing is merely the schema of a regulative principle, by means of which Reason, so far as in her lies, extends the dominion of systematic unity over the whole sphere of experience."
     "It is evident from what has been said that the conception of an absolutely necessary being is a mere idea, the objective reality of which is far from being established by the mere fact that it is a need of reason."
     "It is quite unnecessary for it to renounce the guidance of nature, to attach itself to ideas, the objects of which it cannot know; because, as mere intellectual entities, they cannot be presented in any intuition."
     "Nothing can escape our notice; for what reason produces from itself cannot lie concealed, but must be brought to the light by reason itself, so soon as we have discovered the common principle of the ideas we seek."
     "Now, to employ a conception, the function of judgement is required, by which an object is subsumed under the conception, consequently the at least formal condition, under which something can be given in intuition."
     "Take, for example, the series m, n, o, in which n is given as conditioned in relation to m, but at the same time as the condition of o, and let the series proceed upwards from the conditioned n to m (l, k, i, etc."
     "That is to say, they have a reflective power, and apply to the conception of a thing, of which, in other respects, they affirm nothing, the faculty of cognition in which the conception originates and has its seat."
     "The greater part of operating causes in nature are simultaneous with their effects, and the succession in time of the latter is produced only because the cause cannot achieve the total of its effect in one moment."
     "The illusory conviction, which rests upon subjective causes of association, and which is considered as resulting from the perception of a real and objective natural affinity, is always open to doubt and suspicion."
     "The number of the categories in each class is always the same, namely, three — a fact which also demands some consideration, because in all other cases division à priori through conceptions is necessarily dichotomy."
     "The speculative interest which reason has in those questions is very small; and, for its sake alone, we should not undertake the labour of transcendental investigation — a labour full of toil and ceaseless struggle."
     "There exists, however, a formula of this celebrated principle — a principle merely formal and entirely without content — which contains a synthesis that has been inadvertently and quite unnecessarily mixed up with it."
     "They are merely the pure form of the employment of the understanding in respect of objects in general and of thought, without its being at the same time possible to think or to determine any object by their means."
     "This proposition cannot therefore enounce the identity of the person, by which is understood the consciousness of the identity of its own substance as a thinking being in all change and variation of circumstances."
     "Thus, then, were constructed the monads, which were to form the elements of the universe, the active force of which consists in representation, the effects of this force being thus entirely confined to themselves."
     "To this act we shall give the general appellation of synthesis, thereby to indicate, at the same time, that we cannot represent anything as conjoined in the object without having previously conjoined it ourselves."
     "We distinguished, in the Transcendental Analytic, the dynamical principles of the understanding, which are regulative principles of intuition, from the mathematical, which are constitutive principles of intuition."
     "We merely anticipate our own apprehension, the formal condition of which, inasmuch as it is itself to be found in the mind antecedently to all given phenomena, must certainly be capable of being cognized à priori."
     "We now intend to make a trial whether it be not possible safely to conduct reason between these two rocks, to assign her determinate limits, and yet leave open for her the entire sphere of her legitimate activity."
     "Between two moments there is always a certain time, and between two states existing in these moments there is always a difference having a certain quantity (for all parts of phenomena are in their turn quantities)."
     "But we find in the case of phenomena a particular limitation of the mode in which conditions are given, that is, through the successive synthesis of the manifold of intuition, which must be complete in the regress."
     "But, in answer to these objections, we may adduce the transcendental hypothesis that all life is properly intelligible, and not subject to changes of time, and that it neither began in birth, nor will end in death."
     "For this reason, the exposition of the cause of the amphiboly of these conceptions, as the origin of these false principles, is of great utility in determining with certainty the proper limits of the understanding."
     "If this origin be regarded as the effect of a foreign cause, it is termed creation, which cannot be admitted as an event among phenomena, because the very possibility of it would annihilate the unity of experience."
     "By exposition, I mean the clear, though not detailed, representation of that which belongs to a conception; and an exposition is metaphysical when it contains that which represents the conception as given à priori."
     "Hence those pure synthetical judgements do relate, though but mediately, to possible experience, or rather to the possibility of experience, and upon that alone is founded the objective validity of their synthesis."
     "If, in the second place, both the conditioned and the condition are things in themselves, and if the former is given, not only is the regress to the latter requisite, but the latter is really given with the former."
     "Now, since the world, as a phenomenon, cannot be thus limited in itself for a phenomenon is not a thing in itself; it must be possible for us to have a perception of this limitation by a void time and a void space."
     "That in it which is internal I seek to discover in all parts of space which it occupies, and in all the functions and operations it performs, and which are indeed never anything but phenomena of the external sense."
     "That reason possesses the faculty of causality, or that at least we are compelled so to represent it, is evident from the imperatives, which in the sphere of the practical we impose on many of our executive powers."
     "What is to be done to provide against the danger which seems in the present case to menace the best interests of humanity? The course to be pursued in reference to this subject is a perfectly plain and natural one."
     "When I represent to myself a thing that is permanent, so that everything in it which changes belongs merely to its state or condition, from such a conception alone I never can cognize that such a thing is possible."
     "As the categories are the only conceptions which apply to objects in general, the distinguishing of an object, whether it is something or nothing, must proceed according to the order and direction of the categories."
     "As, therefore, the antithesis will not concede the existence of a first beginning which might be available as a foundation, a complete edifice of cognition, in the presence of such hypothesis, is utterly impossible."
     "But if I cannot reason thus — and I cannot, unless I believe in the sufficiency of the ontological argument — I find insurmountable obstacles in my new path, and am really no farther than the point from which I set out."
     "But the question relates to the mundus phaenomenon, and its quantity; and in this case we cannot make abstraction of the conditions of sensibility, without doing away with the essential reality of this world itself."
     "He is thus to himself, on the one hand, a phenomenon, but on the other hand, in respect of certain faculties, a purely intelligible object — intelligible, because its action cannot be ascribed to sensuous receptivity."
     "I may have sufficient grounds to admit something, or the existence of something, in a relative point of view (suppositio relativa), without being justified in admitting it in an absolute sense (suppositio absoluta)."
     "But whether this consciousness of myself is possible without things external to me; and whether therefore I can exist merely as a thinking being (without being man) — cannot be known or inferred from this proposition."
     "For we have not here to do with the nature of outward objects, which is infinite, but solely with the mind, which judges of the nature of objects, and, again, with the mind only in respect of its cognition à priori."
     "Meanwhile, with respect to these conceptions, as with respect to all our cognition, we certainly may discover in experience, if not the principle of their possibility, yet the occasioning causes of their production."
     "Nay, more, the conception of a cause likewise that of the contingent — loses, in this speculative mode of employing it, all significance, for its objective reality and meaning are comprehensible from experience alone."
     "Now as a division of reason into a logical and a transcendental faculty presents itself here, it becomes necessary to seek for a higher conception of this source of cognition which shall comprehend both conceptions."
     "Now every sensation has a degree or quantity by which it can fill time, that is to say, the internal sense in respect of the representation of an object, more or less, until it vanishes into nothing (= 0 = negatio)."
     "Our present duty is to make ourselves perfectly acquainted with the transcendental use made of pure reason, its principles and ideas, that we may be able properly to determine and value its influence and real worth."
     "Such conceptions of reason are not derived from nature; on the contrary, we employ them for the interrogation and investigation of nature, and regard our cognition as defective so long as it is not adequate to them."
     "The dogmatism of metaphysics, that is, the presumption that it is possible to advance in metaphysics without previous criticism, is the true source of the unbelief (always dogmatic) which militates against morality."
     "The positive value of the critical principles of pure reason in relation to the conception of /God/ and of the /simple nature/ of the /soul/, admits of a similar exemplification; but on this point I shall not dwell."
     "The schema of substance is the permanence of the real in time; that is, the representation of it as a substratum of the empirical determination of time; a substratum which therefore remains, whilst all else changes."
     "These higher principles alone therefore give the conception, which contains the necessary condition, and, as it were, the exponent of a rule; experience, on the other hand, gives the case which comes under the rule."
     "For the very essence of reason consists in its ability to give an account, of all our conceptions, opinions, and assertions — upon objective, or, when they happen to be illusory and fallacious, upon subjective grounds."
     "Hence arises the natural illusion which induces us to believe that these lines proceed from an object which lies out of the sphere of empirical cognition, just as objects reflected in a mirror appear to be behind it."
     "But in transcendental logic it is the most important matter to be dealt with — indeed the only one, if the question is of the possibility of synthetical judgements à priori, the conditions and extent of their validity."
     "Experience must be superadded in order to know these particular laws; but in regard to experience in general, and everything that can be cognized as an object thereof, these à priori laws are our only rule and guide."
     "For it is only about a century and a half since the wise BACON gave a new direction to physical studies, or rather — as others were already on the right track — imparted fresh vigour to the pursuit of this new direction."
     "For the original apperception relates to our internal sense (the complex of all representations), and indeed relates à priori to its form, that is to say, the relation of the manifold empirical consciousness in time."
     "If the Supreme Being forms a link in the chain of empirical conditions, it must be a member of the empirical series, and, like the lower members which it precedes, have its origin in some higher member of the series."
     "If we depart from the subjective condition, under which alone we can obtain external intuition, or, in other words, by means of which we are affected by objects, the representation of space has no meaning whatsoever."
     "In every judgement there is a conception which applies to, and is valid for many other conceptions, and which among these comprehends also a given representation, this last being immediately connected with an object."
     "In this case the condition of that which happens is called a cause; the unconditioned causality of the cause in a phenomenon is termed liberty; the conditioned cause is called in a more limited sense a natural cause."
     "It is thoroughly distinct from scepticism — the principle of a technical and scientific ignorance, which undermines the foundations of all knowledge, in order, if possible, to destroy our belief and confidence therein."
     "Nor is criticism requisite in the sphere of mathematics, where the conceptions of reason must always be presented in concreto in pure intuition, and baseless or arbitrary assertions are discovered without difficulty."
     "Now as time is only the form of intuition, consequently of objects as phenomena, that which in objects corresponds to sensation is the transcendental matter of all objects as things in themselves (Sachheit, reality)."
     "Now this manifold must be combined in original apperception according to relations of time — a necessity imposed by the à priori transcendental unity of apperception, to which is subjected all that can belong to my (i."
     "Our Consciousness of the one, when we speak of the manifold, is always distinguishable from our consciousness of the other; and it is only respecting the synthesis of this (possible) consciousness that we here treat."
     "The principles resulting from this highest principle of pure reason will, however, be transcendent in relation to phenomena, that is to say, it will be impossible to make any adequate empirical use of this principle."
     "The smallest object of experience (for example, only pleasure or pain), that should be included in the general representation of self-consciousness, would immediately change the rational into an empirical psychology."
     "These principles, by placing the goal of all our struggles at so great a distance, realize for us the most thorough connection between the different parts of our cognition, and the highest degree of systematic unity."
     "They contain a certain perfection, attainable by no possible empirical cognition; and they give to reason a systematic unity, to which the unity of experience attempts to approximate, but can never completely attain."
     "By antithetic I do not understand dogmatical assertions of the opposite, but the self-contradiction of seemingly dogmatical cognitions (thesis cum antithesis), in none of which we can discover any decided superiority."
     "I can annihilate in thought every existing substance without self-contradiction, but I cannot infer from this their objective contingency in existence, that is to say, the possibility of their non-existence in itself."
     "If the conception is based upon empirical conditions, if, for example, I have a conception of a clock for a ship, this arbitrary conception does not assure me of the existence or even of the possibility of the object."
     "If, on the contrary, phenomena are held to be, as they are in fact, nothing more than mere representations, connected with each other in accordance with empirical laws, they must have a ground which is not phenomenal."
     "Before all, be it observed, that proper mathematical propositions are always judgements à priori, and not empirical, because they carry along with them the conception of necessity, which cannot be given by experience."
     "But still further removed than the idea from objective reality is the Ideal, by which term I understand the idea, not in concreto, but in individuo — as an individual thing, determinable or determined by the idea alone."
     "But, it will be asked further, can I make any use of this conception and hypothesis in my investigations into the world and nature? Yes, for this very purpose was the idea established by reason as a fundamental basis."
     "For if the categories were inadequate to this task, it would not be evident to us why everything that is presented to our senses must be subject to those laws which have an à priori origin in the understanding itself."
     "Granted that the world has no beginning in time; up to every given moment of time, an eternity must have elapsed, and therewith passed away an infinite series of successive conditions or states of things in the world."
     "Hume is perhaps the ablest and most ingenious of all sceptical philosophers, and his writings have, undoubtedly, exerted the most powerful influence in awakening reason to a thorough investigation into its own powers."
     "I shall show it is as unsuccessful on the one path — the empirical — as on the other — the transcendental, and that it stretches its wings in vain, to soar beyond the world of sense by the mere might of speculative thought."
     "If then, in the speculative sphere of pure reason, no dogmata are to be found; all dogmatical methods, whether borrowed from mathematics, or invented by philosophical thinkers, are alike inappropriate and inefficient."
     "It enables us to see that the proofs of the fourfold antinomy are not mere sophistries — are not fallacious, but grounded on the nature of reason, and valid — under the supposition that phenomena are things in themselves."
     "It is not an organon for the extension, but a discipline for the determination, of the limits of its exercise; and without laying claim to the discovery of new truth, it has the modest merit of guarding against error."
     "On the other hand, the self-evident propositions as to the relation of numbers, are certainly synthetical but not universal, like those of geometry, and for this reason cannot be called axioms, but numerical formulae."
     "Reason must be subject, in all its operations, to criticism, which must always be permitted to exercise its functions without restraint; otherwise its interests are imperilled and its influence obnoxious to suspicion."
     "Supposing that we should carry our empirical intuition even to the very highest degree of clearness, we should not thereby advance one step nearer to a knowledge of the constitution of objects as things in themselves."
     "The manifold in an intuition, which I call mine, is represented by means of the synthesis of the understanding, as belonging to the necessary unity of self-consciousness, and this takes place by means of the category."
     "The proof in favour of the infinity of the cosmical succession and the cosmical content is based upon the consideration that, in the opposite case, a void time and a void space must constitute the limits of the world."
     "There was, then, no real self-contradiction of reason in the propositions: The series of phenomena given in themselves has an absolutely first beginning; and: This series is absolutely and in itself without beginning."
     "For he does not hesitate, perhaps, to venture a ducat, but if it is proposed to stake ten, he immediately becomes aware of the possibility of his being mistaken — a possibility which has hitherto escaped his observation."
     "He then divides the exterior of these angles, by drawing a line parallel with the opposite side of the triangle, and immediately perceives that he has thus got an exterior adjacent angle which is equal to the interior."
     "All the manifold, therefore, in so far as it is given in one empirical intuition, is determined in relation to one of the logical functions of judgement, by means of which it is brought into union in one consciousness."
     "Before concluding this fourth section, and at the same time the system of all principles of the pure understanding, it seems proper to mention the reasons which induced me to term the principles of modality postulates."
     "But there is one thing in the above demonstration of which I could not make abstraction, namely, that the manifold to be intuited must be given previously to the synthesis of the understanding, and independently of it."
     "But within this whole of possible experience lie all our cognitions, and in the universal relation to this experience consists transcendental truth, which antecedes all empirical truth, and renders the latter possible."
     "If we abstract all the content of a judgement, and consider only the intellectual form thereof, we find that the function of thought in a judgement can be brought under four heads, of which each contains three momenta."
     "It now remains for us to consider whether pure reason can be employed in a practical sphere, and whether it will here conduct us to those ideas which attain the highest ends of pure reason, as we have just stated them."
     "My existence is thus already given by the act of consciousness; but the mode in which I must determine my existence, that is, the mode in which I must place the manifold belonging to my existence, is not thereby given."
     "Out of this sphere, they are not properly conceptions, but the mere marks or indices of conceptions, which we may admit, although they cannot, without the help of experience, help us to understand any subject or thing."
     "As regards the former, we can determine our conceptions à priori in intuition, inasmuch as we are ourselves the creators of the objects of the conceptions in space and time — these objects being regarded simply as quanta."
     "But the principles of pure reason cannot be constitutive even in regard to empirical conceptions, because no sensuous schema corresponding to them can be discovered, and they cannot therefore have an object in concreto."
     "If we do not set out from experience, or do not proceed according to the laws of the empirical connection of phenomena, our pretensions to discover the existence of a thing which we do not immediately perceive are vain."
     "But I am conscious, through internal /experience/, of my /existence in time/ (consequently, also, of the determinability of the former in the latter), and that is more than the simple consciousness of my representation."
     "For one part of our pure knowledge, the science of mathematics, has been long firmly established, and thus leads us to form flattering expectations with regard to others, though these may be of quite a different nature."
     "In every reasoning or syllogism, there is a fundamental proposition, afterwards a second drawn from it, and finally the conclusion, which connects the truth in the first with the truth in the second — and that infallibly."
     "In relation, however, to the principle, whereby reason sets bounds to a freedom which is in itself without law, and consequently when we attend merely to their form, they may be considered as pure conceptions of reason."
     "Now it is quite clear that there must be some third thing, which on the one side is homogeneous with the category, and with the phenomenon on the other, and so makes the application of the former to the latter possible."
     "Such a conception can always be defined; for I must know thoroughly what I wished to cogitate in it, as it was I who created it, and it was not given to my mind either by the nature of my understanding or by experience."
     "That /Logic/ has advanced in this sure course, even from the earliest times, is apparent from the fact that, since Aristotle, it has been unable to advance a step and, thus, to all appearance has reached its completion."
     "The former denotes the determinable in general, the second its determination, both in a transcendental sense, abstraction being made of every difference in that which is given, and of the mode in which it is determined."
     "The principles of the pure understanding, whether constitutive à priori (as the mathematical principles), or merely regulative (as the dynamical), contain nothing but the pure schema, as it were, of possible experience."
     "We can now establish this assertion, which at first sight appeared so rash, in relation to the two questions in which reason takes the greatest interest, and thus complete our discussion of the dialectic of pure reason."
     "We cannot be said to know what has been above asserted, nor do we seriously maintain the truth of these assertions; and the notions therein indicated are not even ideas of reason, they are purely fictitious conceptions."
     "From the cognition of self to the cognition of the world, and through these to the supreme being, the progression is so natural, that it seems to resemble the logical march of reason from the premisses to the conclusion."
     "From this we see that reason endeavours to subject the great variety of the cognitions of the understanding to the smallest possible number of principles (general conditions), and thus to produce in it the highest unity."
     "If we imagine to ourselves that we have to stake the happiness of our whole life on the truth of any proposition, our judgement drops its air of triumph, we take the alarm, and discover the actual strength of our belief."
     "Again, the dogmatical opponent of religion gives employment to criticism, and enables us to test and correct its principles, while there is no occasion for anxiety in regard to the influence and results of his reasoning."
     "Either the predicate B belongs to the subject A, as somewhat which is contained (though covertly) in the conception A; or the predicate B lies completely out of the conception A, although it stands in connection with it."
     "General logic, as has been repeatedly said, makes abstraction of all content of cognition, and expects to receive representations from some other quarter, in order, by means of analysis, to convert them into conceptions."
     "Hence the pure rational conceptions of totality in the synthesis of conditions have a necessary foundation in the nature of human reason — at least as modes of elevating the unity of the understanding to the unconditioned."
     "In effect, Reason has only one single interest, and the seeming contradiction existing between her maxims merely indicates a difference in, and a reciprocal limitation of, the methods by which this interest is satisfied."
     "It is, hence, a principle of reason, which, as a rule, dictates how we ought to proceed in our empirical regress, but is unable to anticipate or indicate prior to the empirical regress what is given in the object itself."
     "That is to say, if the state, b, differs from the state, a, only in respect to quantity, the change is a coming into existence of b -a, which in the former state did not exist, and in relation to which that state is = O."
     "The aim of the cosmological argument is to avoid the necessity of proving the existence of a necessary being priori from mere conceptions — a proof which must be ontological, and of which we feel ourselves quite incapable."
     "The former restricts itself to the absolute totality in the employment of the conceptions of the understanding and aims at carrying out the synthetical unity which is cogitated in the category, even to the unconditioned."
     "The human will is certainly an arbitrium sensitivum, not brutum, but liberum; because sensuousness does not necessitate its action, a faculty existing in man of self-determination, independently of all sensuous coercion."
     "The latter must consist in the order of the manifold in a phenomenon, according to which order the apprehension of one thing (that which happens) follows that of another thing (which precedes), in conformity with a rule."
     "The third idea of pure reason, containing the hypothesis of a being which is valid merely as a relative hypothesis, is that of the one and all-sufficient cause of all cosmological series, in other words, the idea of God."
     "The transcendental doctrine of sense must form the first part of our science of elements, because the conditions under which alone the objects of human knowledge are given must precede those under which they are thought."
     "This principle makes the unity of experience possible and borrows nothing from reason, which, without a reference to possible experience, could never have produced by means of mere conceptions any such synthetical unity."
     "But we cannot stop at these doubts, much less regard the conviction of our ignorance, not only as a cure for the conceit natural to dogmatism, but as the settlement of the disputes in which reason is involved with itself."
     "For one part of space, although it may be perfectly similar and equal to another part, is still without it, and for this reason alone is different from the latter, which is added to it in order to make up a greater space."
     "I cogitate myself in behalf of a possible experience, at the same time making abstraction of all actual experience; and infer therefrom that I can be conscious of myself apart from experience and its empirical conditions."
     "If we employ our reason not merely in the application of the principles of the understanding to objects of experience, but venture with it beyond these boundaries, there arise certain sophistical propositions or theorems."
     "If we leave this ground of experience, they become mere fictions of thought, the possibility of which is quite indemonstrable; and they cannot, consequently, be employed as hypotheses in the explanation of real phenomena."
     "If, thirdly, the question is whether we may not cogitate this being, which is distinct from the world, in analogy with the objects of experience? The answer is: Undoubtedly, but only as an ideal, and not as a real object."
     "But this synthesis is cogitated only in the schema of the pure conception of the understanding, of whose unity, as that of a synthesis in general, the category contains the function unrestricted by any sensuous condition."
     "Examples are always contagious; and they exert an especial influence on the same faculty, which naturally flatters itself that it will have the same good fortune in other case as fell to its lot in one fortunate instance."
     "I accordingly maintain that transcendental ideas can never be employed as constitutive ideas, that they cannot be conceptions of objects, and that, when thus considered, they assume a fallacious and dialectical character."
     "I call a conception problematical which contains in itself no contradiction, and which is connected with other cognitions as a limitation of given conceptions, but whose objective reality cannot be cognized in any manner."
     "In order to prevent any misunderstanding, it will be requisite, in the first place, to recapitulate, as clearly as possible, what our opinion is with respect to the fundamental nature of our sensuous cognition in general."
     "In the next place we shall take away from this intuition all that belongs to sensation, so that nothing may remain but pure intuition, and the mere form of phenomena, which is all that the sensibility can afford à priori."
     "In this case, I find it impossible to represent this necessity in or by any conception, and it exists merely in my own mind, as the formal condition of thought, but not as a material and hypostatic condition of existence."
     "It is, indeed, the common fate of human reason in speculation, to finish the imposing edifice of thought as rapidly as possible, and then for the first time to begin to examine whether the foundation is a solid one or no."
     "Such are those who affirm the possibility of thought — of which they have no other knowledge than what they derive from its use in connecting empirical intuitions presented in this our human life — after this life has ceased."
     "That is to say, his own declarations are doubted, for his objections were based upon facta, which are contingent, and not upon principles, which can alone demonstrate the necessary invalidity of all dogmatical assertions."
     "The content of both is the same; and there is no addition made to the conception, which expresses merely the possibility of the object, by my cogitating the object — in the expression, it is — as absolutely given or existing."
     "The supreme principle of the possibility of all intuition in relation to sensibility was, according to our transcendental æsthetic, that all the manifold in intuition be subject to the formal conditions of space and time."
     "Thus, too, it becomes sufficiently manifest why we required the idea of a necessary being in relation to objects given by sense, although we can never have the least conception of this being, or of its absolute necessity."
     "Human reason, in one sphere of its cognition, is called upon to consider questions, which it cannot decline, as they are presented by its own nature, but which it cannot answer, as they transcend every faculty of the mind."
     "Besides, a new illusory argument, in the construction of which talent and acuteness are shown, is suggestive of new ideas and new trains of reasoning, and in this respect the old and everyday sophistries are quite useless."
     "But an ideal of pure reason cannot be termed mysterious or inscrutable, because the only credential of its reality is the need of it felt by reason, for the purpose of giving completeness to the world of synthetical unity."
     "But even the alternation of the existence and non-existence of a given state in a thing, in which all change consists, by no means proves the contingency of that state — the ground of proof being the reality of its opposite."
     "But the more enlarged treatment of moral ideas, which was rendered necessary by the extreme pure moral law of our religion, awakened the interest, and thereby quickened the perceptions of reason in relation to this object."
     "For if that in the phenomenon which we call substance is to be the proper substratum of all determination of time, it follows that all existence in past as well as in future time, must be determinable by means of it alone."
     "For they are not subordinated to each other as conditions of the possibility of each other; which, however, may be affirmed of spaces, the limits of which are never determined in themselves, but always by some other space."
     "As no representation, except an intuition, relates immediately to its object, a conception never relates immediately to an object, but only to some other representation thereof, be that an intuition or itself a conception."
     "But even if we could frame any synthetical proposition concerning things in themselves by means of the pure understanding (which is impossible), it could not apply to phenomena, which do not represent things in themselves."
     "He was the first to point out the necessity of establishing fixed principles, of clearly defining our conceptions, and of subjecting our demonstrations to the most severe scrutiny, instead of rashly jumping at conclusions."
     "In this cosmological argument are assembled so many sophistical propositions that speculative reason seems to have exerted in it all her dialectical skill to produce a transcendental illusion of the most extreme character."
     "The affirmations of the thesis, on the contrary, were based, in addition to the empirical mode of explanation employed in the series of phenomena, on intellectual propositions; and its principles were in so far not simple."
     "The cause of the empirical condition of this progression — and consequently at what member therein I must stop, and at what point in the regress I am to find this member — is transcendental, and hence necessarily incognizable."
     "The common understanding does not find the least difficulty in the idea of the unconditioned beginning of all synthesis — accustomed, as it is, rather to follow our consequences than to seek for a proper basis for cognition."
     "The sum of all the possible objects of our cognition seems to us to be a level surface, with an apparent horizon — that which forms the limit of its extent, and which has been termed by us the idea of unconditioned totality."
     "They have hardly ever reflected or philosophized on their favourite science — a task of great difficulty; and the specific difference between the two modes of employing the faculty of reason has never entered their thoughts."
     "This equality of fortune does not allow the one party to be superior to the other in the sphere of speculative cognition; and it is this sphere, accordingly, that is the proper arena of these endless speculative conflicts."
     "Thus, when I say that certain events occurred in past time, I merely assert the possibility of prolonging the chain of experience, from the present perception, upwards to the conditions that determine it according to time."
     "We abstract from the object of the idea all the conditions which limit the exercise of our understanding, but which, on the other hand, are the sole conditions of our possessing a determinate conception of any given thing."
     "We must therefore seek for, first, an unconditioned of the categorical synthesis in a subject; secondly, of the hypothetical synthesis of the members of a series; thirdly, of the disjunctive synthesis of parts in a system."
     "But time itself is not an object of perception; and therefore we cannot conclude from the fact that things are placed in the same time, the other fact, that the perception of these things can follow each other reciprocally."
     "For otherwise I could not say of the object that it follows; because the mere succession in my apprehension, if it be not determined by a rule in relation to something preceding, does not authorize succession in the object."
     "For the conception merely enables me to cogitate an object as according with the general conditions of experience; while the existence of the object permits me to cogitate it as contained in the sphere of actual experience."
     "From what source does this free-thinker derive his knowledge that there is, for example, no Supreme Being? This proposition lies out of the field of possible experience, and, therefore, beyond the limits of human cognition."
     "Hence we were unable to demonstrate it from the conception of a given object of external intuition (of the composite), but we were obliged to prove it from the relation of a given object to a possible experience in general."
     "Here, certainly, reason establishes, with much plausibility, its principle of unconditioned unity; but it very soon falls into such contradictions that it is compelled, in relation to cosmology, to renounce its pretensions."
     "By confining the view to particular passages, taking these out of their connection and comparing them with one another, it is easy to pick out apparent contradictions, especially in a work written with any freedom of style."
     "For example, the two triangles into which a square is divided by a diagonal, do not necessarily belong to each other, and of this kind is the synthesis of the homogeneous in everything that can be mathematically considered."
     "I call the world a moral world, in so far as it may be in accordance with all the ethical laws — which, by virtue of the freedom of reasonable beings, it can be, and according to the necessary laws of morality it ought to be."
     "In all judgements wherein the relation of a subject to the predicate is cogitated (I mention affirmative judgements only here; the application to negative will be very easy), this relation is possible in two different ways."
     "In the foregoing chapter we have merely considered the general conditions under which alone the transcendental faculty of judgement is justified in using the pure conceptions of the understanding for synthetical judgements."
     "In this proposition there is therefore something more to be found than the mere spontaneity of thought; there is also the receptivity of intuition, that is, my thought of myself applied to the empirical intuition of myself."
     "Instead of the word definition, I should rather employ the term exposition — a more modest expression, which the critic may accept without surrendering his doubts as to the completeness of the analysis of any such conception."
     "Now all pure conceptions have to do in general with the synthetical unity of representations; conceptions of pure reason (transcendental ideas), on the other hand, with the unconditional synthetical unity of all conditions."
     "Now the mode in which we apprehend a thing in a phenomenon can be determined à priori in such a manner that the rule of its synthesis can give, that is to say, can produce this à priori intuition in every empirical example."
     "Now the principle of contradiction as a merely logical proposition must not by any means limit its application merely to relations of time, and consequently a formula like the preceding is quite foreign to its true purpose."
     "Now, as the world is an absolute whole, out of and beyond which no object of intuition, and consequently no correlate to which can be discovered, this relation of the world to a void space is merely a relation to no object."
     "That it may possess a secure foundation, it bases its conclusions upon experience, and thus appears to be completely distinct from the ontological argument, which places its confidence entirely in pure à priori conceptions."
     "The first error which arises from our employing the idea of a Supreme Being as a constitutive (in repugnance to the very nature of an idea), and not as a regulative principle, is the error of inactive reason (ignava ratio)."
     "Thus then, of two dialectically opposed judgements both may be false, from the fact, that the one is not a mere contradictory of the other, but actually enounces more than is requisite for a full and complete contradiction."
     "We have, however, shown in its place that community is the proper ground of the possibility of an empirical cognition of coexistence, and that we may therefore properly reason from the latter to the former as its condition."
     "With the same right, accordingly, can we postulate the principles of modality, because they do not augment the conception of a thing but merely indicate the manner in which it is connected with the faculty of cognition."
     "All sensuous phenomena may be contingent, and consequently possess only an empirically conditioned existence, and yet there may also exist a non-empirical condition of the whole series, or, in other words, a necessary being."
     "But as this word has long been employed to designate a particular theory of corporeal phenomena (moleculae), and thus presupposes a basis of empirical conceptions, I prefer calling it the dialectical principle of Monadology."
     "For this internal necessity is in certain cases a mere empty word with which the least conception cannot be connected, while the conception of the necessity of a thing in all relations possesses very peculiar determinations."
     "If, however, I regard all things not as phenomena, but as things in themselves and objects of understanding alone, they, although substances, may be considered as dependent, in respect of their existence, on a foreign cause."
     "At the foundation of this term lies the disappointed hope, which the eminent analyst, Baumgarten, conceived, of subjecting the criticism of the beautiful to principles of reason, and so of elevating its rules into a science."
     "But transcendental logic considers also the worth or content of this logical affirmation — an affirmation by means of a merely negative predicate, and inquires how much the sum total of our cognition gains by this affirmation."
     "By whatever and by whatever number of predicates — even to the complete determination of it — I may cogitate a thing, I do not in the least augment the object of my conception by the addition of the statement: This thing exists."
     "For as regards the correctness and precision of the insight of the understanding, examples are commonly injurious rather than otherwise, because, as casus in terminis they seldom adequately fulfil the conditions of the rule."
     "I premise that by the term synthesis of apprehension I understand the combination of the manifold in an empirical intuition, whereby perception, that is, empirical consciousness of the intuition (as phenomenon), is possible."
     "In such a case I should be obliged in transcendental reflection to compare my conceptions only under the conditions of sensibility, and so space and time would not be determinations of things in themselves, but of phenomena."
     "In such an act the understanding determines the internal sense by the synthetical conjunction which it cogitates, conformably to the internal intuition which corresponds to the manifold in the synthesis of the understanding."
     "In truth, if I cognize in all its inner determinations a drop of water as a thing in itself, I cannot look upon one drop as different from another, if the conception of the one is completely identical with that of the other."
     "It is an operation of the understanding on sensibility, and the first application of the understanding to objects of possible intuition, and at the same time the basis for the exercise of the other functions of that faculty."
     "It is very remarkable that we cannot perceive the possibility of a thing from the category alone, but must always have an intuition, by which to make evident the objective reality of the pure conception of the understanding."
     "Physico-theology is therefore incapable of presenting a determinate conception of a supreme cause of the world, and is therefore insufficient as a principle of theology — a theology which is itself to be the basis of religion."
     "The condition must be taken in exactly the same signification as the relation of the conditioned to its condition in the series has been taken, for the series must conduct us in an unbroken regress to this supreme condition."
     "The principle of an unbroken connection between all events in the phenomenal world, in accordance with the unchangeable laws of nature, is a well-established principle of transcendental analytic which admits of no exception."
     "The time between the causality of the cause and its immediate effect may entirely vanish, and the cause and effect be thus simultaneous, but the relation of the one to the other remains always determinable according to time."
     "These prejudicial consequences become still more evident, in the case of the dogmatical treatment of our idea of a Supreme Intelligence, and the theological system of nature (physico-theology) which is falsely based upon it."
     "We shall term those principles the application of which is confined entirely within the limits of possible experience, immanent; those, on the other hand, which transgress these limits, we shall call transcendent principles."
     "A conception of space and time as quanta may be presented à priori in intuition, that is, constructed, either alone with their quality (figure), or as pure quantity (the mere synthesis of the homogeneous), by means of number."
     "But the sole condition, so far as my knowledge extends, under which this unity can be my guide in the investigation of nature, is the assumption that a supreme intelligence has ordered all things according to the wisest ends."
     "But this does not hold good of the Totum substantiale phaenomenon, which, as an empirical intuition in space, possesses the necessary property of containing no simple part, for the very reason that no part of space is simple."
     "But to cogitate an intelligible ground of phenomena, as free, moreover, from the contingency of the latter, conflicts neither with the unlimited nature of the empirical regress, nor with the complete contingency of phenomena."
     "He can only say: If we perceived their origin and their authenticity, we should be able to determine the extent and limits of reason; but, till we can do this, all propositions regarding the latter are mere random assertions."
     "And as time itself cannot be perceived, the determination of the existence of objects in time can only take place by means of their connection in time in general, consequently only by means of à priori connecting conceptions."
     "But as such persons frequently labour under a deficiency in the faculty of judgement, it is not uncommon to find men extremely learned who in the application of their science betray a lamentable degree this irremediable want."
     "But it is still more remarkable that, to understand the possibility of things according to the categories and thus to demonstrate the objective reality of the latter, we require not merely intuitions, but external intuitions."
     "But this synthetical unity can be no other than that of the conjunction of the manifold of a given intuition in general, in a primitive act of consciousness, according to the categories, but applied to our sensuous intuition."
     "For this result, then, we are indebted to a criticism which warns us of our unavoidable ignorance with regard to things in themselves, and establishes the necessary limitation of our theoretical /cognition/ to mere phenomena."
     "It is, on the contrary, manifest that a permanent phenomenon in space (impenetrable extension) can contain mere relations, and nothing that is absolutely internal, and yet be the primary substratum of all external perception."
     "It was by no means a natural course of proceeding, but, on the contrary, an invention entirely due to the subtlety of the schools, to attempt to draw from a mere idea a proof of the existence of an object corresponding to it."
     "It would be absurd to say that anything in nature ought to be other than it is in the relations of time in which it stands; indeed, the ought, when we consider merely the course of nature, has neither application nor meaning."
     "Now, the relations in which conceptions can stand to each other are those of identity and difference, agreement and opposition, of the internal and external, finally, of the determinable and the determining (matter and form)."
     "Reason, as observed in the syllogistic process, is not applicable to intuitions, for the purpose of subjecting them to rules — for this is the province of the understanding with its categories — but to conceptions and judgements."
     "They are purely problematical in their nature and, as aids to the heuristic exercise of the faculties, form the basis of the regulative principles for the systematic employment of the understanding in the field of experience."
     "This antinomy of reason may, however, be really profitable to our speculative interests, not in the way of contributing any dogmatical addition, but as presenting to us another material support in our critical investigations."
     "What use can we make of our understanding, even in respect of experience, if we do not propose ends to ourselves? But the highest ends are those of morality, and it is only pure reason that can give us the knowledge of these."
     "Whether the treatment of that portion of our knowledge which lies within the province of pure reason advances with that undeviating certainty which characterizes the progress of /science/, we shall be at no loss to determine."
     "All conceptions of negatives are accordingly derived or deduced conceptions; and realities contain the data, and, so to speak, the material or transcendental content of the possibility and complete determination of all things."
     "All this being granted, it is nevertheless indisputable, that we must assume these two nonentities, void space without and void time before the world, if we assume the existence of cosmical limits, relatively to space or time."
     "But as regards time future, which is not the condition of arriving at the present, in order to conceive it; it is quite indifferent whether we consider future time as ceasing at some point, or as prolonging itself to infinity."
     "But, on the other hand, if misunderstood and employed as constitutive principles of transcendent cognition, they become the parents of illusions and contradictions, while pretending to introduce us to new regions of knowledge."
     "For it must be confessed of the categories that they are not of themselves sufficient for the cognition of things in themselves and, without the data of sensibility, are mere subjective forms of the unity of the understanding."
     "For it will be made manifest to the reader that, although experience presents the occasion and the starting-point, it is the transcendental idea of reason which guides it in its pilgrimage and is the goal of all its struggles."
     "For the purely intellectual conception of the contingent cannot produce any synthetical proposition, like that of causality, which is itself without significance or distinguishing characteristic except in the phenomenal world."
     "For, in the present case, the condition stands out of and beyond the series of phenomena — it is intelligible, and it consequently cannot be subjected to any sensuous condition, or to any time-determination by a preceding cause."
     "Hence it is requisite that an abstract conception be made sensuous, that is, that an object corresponding to it in intuition be forthcoming, otherwise the conception remains, as we say, without sense, that is, without meaning."
     "If the mode of this intuition is unknown to us, the object is merely transcendental, and the conception of the understanding is employed only transcendentally, that is, to produce unity in the thought of a manifold in general."
     "For the conjunction of the first and second, in order to produce the third conception, requires a particular function of the understanding, which is by no means identical with those which are exercised in the first and second."
     "In such a case, we cannot make a better choice, or rather we have no choice at all, but feel ourselves obliged to declare in favour of the absolute unity of complete reality, as the highest source of the possibility of things."
     "Reason presupposes the existence of cognitions of the understanding, which have a direct relation to experience, and aims at the ideal unity of these cognitions — a unity which far transcends all experience or empirical notions."
     "The unity of reason is the unity of system; and this systematic unity is not an objective principle, extending its dominion over objects, but a subjective maxim, extending its authority over the empirical cognition of objects."
     "This happens from the fact that, for a given conditioned, reason demands absolute totality on the side of the conditions (to which the understanding submits all phenomena), and thus makes of the category a transcendental idea."
     "Time is in itself a series (and the formal condition of all series), and hence, in relation to a given present, we must distinguish à priori in it the antecedentia as conditions (time past) from the consequentia (time future)."
     "We cannot cogitate a geometrical line without drawing it in thought, nor a circle without describing it, nor represent the three dimensions of space without drawing three lines from the same point perpendicular to one another."
     "What causes us here commonly to believe that the predicate of such apodeictic judgements is already contained in our conception, and that the judgement is therefore analytical, is merely the equivocal nature of the expression."
     "As this merely formal logic makes abstraction of all content of cognition, whether pure or empirical, and occupies itself with the mere form of thought (discursive cognition), it must contain in its analytic a canon for reason."
     "But it is evident that, as all phenomena are subject to change and conditioned in their existence, the series of dependent existences cannot embrace an unconditioned member, the existence of which would be absolutely necessary."
     "Hence we are entitled to apply the term substance to a phenomenon, only because we suppose its existence in all time, a notion which the word permanence does not fully express, as it seems rather to be referable to future time."
     "In the case of the apparent antinomy with which we are at present dealing, there exists a way of escape from the difficulty; for it is not impossible that both of the contradictory statements may be true in different relations."
     "It introduces aims and ends into a sphere in which our observation could not of itself have discovered them, and extends our knowledge of nature, by directing our attention to a unity, the principle of which lies beyond nature."
     "It is easy to perceive that the sole aim of pure reason is the absolute totality of the synthesis on the side of the conditions, and that it does not concern itself with the absolute completeness on the Part of the conditioned."
     "That there may be inhabitants in the moon, although no one has ever observed them, must certainly be admitted; but this assertion means only, that we may in the possible progress of experience discover them at some future time."
     "The latter would have remained forever undiscovered, if Copernicus had not ventured on the experiment — contrary to the senses but still just — of looking for the observed movements not in the heavenly bodies, but in the spectator."
     "The more legislation and government are in harmony with this idea, the more rare do punishments become and thus it is quite reasonable to maintain, as Plato did, that in a perfect state no punishments at all would be necessary."
     "The question naturally arises: What is the cause which necessitates this twofold exercise of reason, and how are we to discover whether it is the philosophical or the mathematical method which reason is pursuing in an argument?"
     "Thus I can perceive the moon and then the earth, or conversely, first the earth and then the moon; and for the reason that my perceptions of these objects can reciprocally follow each other, I say, they exist contemporaneously."
     "Without their original applicability and relation to all possible experience, in which all objects of cognition present themselves, the relation of the categories to objects, of whatever nature, would be quite incomprehensible."
     "And this reason does, not only, as in the case above adduced, with regard to the unity of substance, but where many substances, although all to a certain extent homogeneous, are discoverable, as in the case of matter in general."
     "But as all division presupposes a divided conception, a still higher one must exist, and this is the conception of an object in general — problematically understood and without its being decided whether it is something or nothing."
     "But if the conditions of the exercise of free volition are empirical, reason can have only a regulative, and not a constitutive, influence upon it, and is serviceable merely for the introduction of unity into its empirical laws."
     "But reason cannot cogitate this systematic unity, without at the same time cogitating an object of the idea — an object that cannot be presented in any experience, which contains no concrete example of a complete systematic unity."
     "Inasmuch as all external relation, consequently all composition of substances, is possible only in space; the space, occupied by that which is composite, must consist of the same number of parts as is contained in the composite."
     "It differs, however, in this respect from that of time, that the side of the conditioned is not in itself distinguishable from the side of the condition; and, consequently, regressus and progressus in space seem to be identical."
     "It is certainly allowable to admit the existence of an all-sufficient being — a cause of all possible effects — for the purpose of enabling reason to introduce unity into its mode and grounds of explanation with regard to phenomena."
     "The practical law based on the motive of happiness I term a pragmatical law (or prudential rule); but that law, assuming such to exist, which has no other motive than the worthiness of being happy, I term a moral or ethical law."
     "The principal thing we must attend to, in the division of the parts of a science like this, is that no conceptions must enter it which contain aught empirical; in other words, that the knowledge à priori must be completely pure."
     "The proof proceeds thus: A necessary being can be determined only in one way, that is, it can be determined by only one of all possible opposed predicates; consequently, it must be completely determined in and by its conception."
     "There must, therefore, be but one ground of proof, because it is the conception alone which determines the object; and thus the proof cannot contain anything more than the determination of the object according to the conception."
     "This principle indicates that all differences of species limit each other, and do not admit of transition from one to another by a saltus, but only through smaller degrees of the difference between the one species and the other."
     "Thus, under the name of a transcendental synthesis of imagination, the understanding exercises an activity upon the passive subject, whose faculty it is; and so we are right in saying that the internal sense is affected thereby."
     "All sequence of perception would then exist only in apprehension, that is to say, would be merely subjective, and it could not thereby be objectively determined what thing ought to precede, and what ought to follow in perception."
     "But in the minor we speak of the same being only in so far as it regards itself as subject, relatively to thought and the unity of consciousness, but not in relation to intuition, by which it is presented as an object to thought."
     "For, as soon as I draw some water with the glass from a larger vessel, an effect follows thereupon, namely, the change of the horizontal state which the water had in the large vessel into a concave, which it assumes in the glass."
     "I have termed it for this reason a regulative principle of reason; while the principle of the absolute totality of the series of conditions, as existing in itself and given in the object, is a constitutive cosmological principle."
     "As this division appears to differ in some, though not essential points, from the usual technique of logicians, the following observations, for the prevention of otherwise possible misunderstanding, will not be without their use."
     "But besides intuition there is no other mode of cognition, except through conceptions; consequently, the cognition of every, at least of every human, understanding is a cognition through conceptions — not intuitive, but discursive."
     "Finally, the disjunctive judgement contains a relation of two or more propositions to each other — a relation not of consequence, but of logical opposition, in so far as the sphere of the one proposition excludes that of the other."
     "For it will thus become quite evident that, turn and twist our conceptions as we may, it is impossible, without having recourse to intuition, to arrive at the sum total or product by means of the mere analysis of our conceptions."
     "In the above example, we merely attempted to show the great difference which exists between the discursive employment of reason in the sphere of conceptions, and its intuitive exercise by means of the construction of conceptions."
     "In the other case, reason proceeds by the construction of conceptions; and, as these conceptions relate to an à priori intuition, they may be given and determined in pure intuition à priori, and without the aid of empirical data."
     "Intuition and conceptions constitute, therefore, the elements of all our knowledge, so that neither conceptions without an intuition in some way corresponding to them, nor intuition without conceptions, can afford us a cognition."
     "It cannot be affirmed with propriety that this idea is a conception of an object; it is merely a conception of the complete unity of the conceptions of objects, in so far as this unity is available to the understanding as a rule."
     "The latter, namely, empirical conceptions, together with the empirical intuition on which they are founded, cannot afford any synthetical proposition, except such as is itself also empirical, that is, a proposition of experience."
     "The reader must naturally have a strong inducement to co-operate with the present author, if he has formed the intention of erecting a complete and solid edifice of metaphysical science, according to the plan now laid before him."
     "The second important concern of our æsthetic is that it does not obtain favour merely as a plausible hypothesis, but possess as undoubted a character of certainty as can be demanded of any theory which is to serve for an organon."
     "These principles have this peculiarity, that they do not concern phenomena, and the synthesis of the empirical intuition thereof, but merely the existence of phenomena and their relation to each other in regard to this existence."
     "Those who reject at once the method of Wolf, and of the Critique of Pure Reason, can have no other aim but to shake off the fetters of /science/, to change labour into sport, certainty into opinion, and philosophy into philodoxy."
     "Thus the conduct of this wise and divine man serves us as a standard of action, with which we may compare and judge ourselves, which may help us to reform ourselves, although the perfection it demands can never be attained by us."
     "Even the idea of eternity, terrible and sublime as it is, as depicted by Haller, does not produce upon the mental vision such a feeling of awe and terror; for, although it measures the duration of things, it does not support them."
     "For if there is one proposition in his chain of reasoning which be he cannot prove, or the fallacy in which he cannot evolve in accordance with a principle, suspicion falls on all his statements, however plausible they may appear."
     "For, in such a case, that which is originally a mere phenomenon, a rose, for example, is taken by the empirical understanding for a thing in itself, though to every different eye, in respect of its colour, it may appear different."
     "For, without having attempted to discover the unity of the various powers existing in nature, nay, even after all our attempts have failed, we notwithstanding presuppose that it does exist, and may be, sooner or later, discovered."
     "In the same manner several simple substances might coalesce into one, without anything being lost except the plurality of subsistence, inasmuch as the one substance would contain the degree of reality of all the former substances."
     "In this latter case, the conditions do not exist in the series of phenomena, but may be placed quite out of and beyond it, and the series of conditions may be regarded as if it had an absolute beginning from an intelligible cause."
     "Mathematical axioms (for example, there can be only one straight line between two points) are general à priori cognitions, and are therefore rightly denominated principles, relatively to the cases which can be subsumed under them."
     "Now, if I grant that they cannot be employed in the sphere of experience, as constitutive principles, how shall I secure for them employment and objective validity as regulative principles, and in what way can they be so employed?"
     "Or, if I conjoin the conception of a cause with that of a substance, it does not follow that the conception of influence, that is, how one substance can be the cause of something in another substance, will be understood from that."
     "The absolute totality of the series of these conditions is an idea, which can never be fully realized in the empirical exercise of reason, while it is serviceable as a rule for the procedure of reason in relation to that totality."
     "The categories of modality possess this peculiarity, that they do not in the least determine the object, or enlarge the conception to which they are annexed as predicates, but only express its relation to the faculty of cognition."
     "The critical examination, in our Transcendental Analytic, of all the propositions which professed to extend cognition beyond the sphere of experience, completely demonstrated that they can only conduct us to a possible experience."
     "We are not discussing the above-mentioned assertions regarding the immaterial unity of the soul and the existence of a Supreme Being as dogmata, which certain philosophers profess to demonstrate à priori, but purely as hypotheses."
     "When we are thus far advanced, we need fear no further attacks; for the limits of our domain are clearly marked out, and we can make no claims nor become involved in any disputes regarding the region that lies beyond these limits."
     "As space is not a composite of substances (and not even of real accidents), if I abstract all composition therein — nothing, not even a point, remains; for a point is possible only as the limit of a space — consequently of a composite."
     "But we are at present engaged in the discussion of things which are not objects of experience; and must, therefore, deduce our knowledge of them from that which is necessary absolutely and in itself, that is, from pure conceptions."
     "But we need not detain ourselves with this question, for it has already been sufficiently answered in our discussion of the antinomies into which reason falls, when it attempts to reach the unconditioned in the series of phenomena."
     "But where will he find the knowledge which can enable him to enounce synthetical judgements in regard to things which transcend the region of experience? We may, therefore, rest assured that the opposite never will be demonstrated."
     "Consequently, every transition from one state into another is always effected in a time contained between two moments, of which the first determines the state which leaves, and the second determines the state into the thing passes."
     "But the conjunction (conjunctio) of a manifold in intuition never can be given us by the senses; it cannot therefore be contained in the pure form of sensuous intuition, for it is a spontaneous act of the faculty of representation."
     "Geometry, nevertheless, advances steadily and securely in the province of pure à priori cognitions, without needing to ask from philosophy any certificate as to the pure and legitimate origin of its fundamental conception of space."
     "In mathematics its use would be absurd; because in it no false assertions can long remain hidden, inasmuch as its demonstrations must always proceed under the guidance of pure intuition, and by means of an always evident synthesis."
     "In the argument or syllogism of the first class, I conclude, from the transcendental conception of the subject contains no manifold, the absolute unity of the subject itself, of which I cannot in this manner attain to a conception."
     "In virtue of its intelligible character, on the other hand (although we possess only a general conception of this character), the subject must be regarded as free from all sensuous influences, and from all phenomenal determination."
     "It is, moreover, just as natural to regard phenomena (in the minor) as things in themselves and as objects presented to the pure understanding, as in the major, in which complete abstraction was made of all conditions of intuition."
     "The two propositions are perfectly consistent with each other, because phenomena as phenomena are in themselves nothing, and consequently the hypothesis that they are things in themselves must lead to self-contradictory inferences."
     "They are mere forms of thought, without objective reality, because we have no intuition to which the synthetical unity of apperception, which alone the categories contain, could be applied, for the purpose of determining an object."
     "This can never become popular and, indeed, has no occasion to be so; for finespun arguments in favour of useful truths make just as little impression on the public mind as the equally subtle objections brought against these truths."
     "Thus it represents thinking substance as the principle of life in matter, that is, as a soul (anima), and as the ground of Animality; and this, limited and determined by the conception of spirituality, gives us that of Immortality."
     "Thus the customary mode of speaking confirms the explanation given above, and the conclusion arrived at, that only those judgements which are based upon conceptions, not on the construction of conceptions, can be termed dogmatical."
     "We now come to a conception which was not inserted in the general list of transcendental conceptions, and yet must be reckoned with them, but at the same time without in the least altering, or indicating a deficiency in that table."
     "What I have termed an ideal was in Plato’s philosophy an idea of the divine mind — an individual object present to its pure intuition, the most perfect of every kind of possible beings, and the archetype of all phenomenal existences."
     "But, let me form any conception whatever of a thing, I find that I cannot cogitate the existence of the thing as absolutely necessary, and that nothing prevents me — be the thing or being what it may — from cogitating its non-existence."
     "As to the first and only means to arrive at such cognitions, namely, through mere conceptions or intuitions à priori, it is quite clear that from mere conceptions no synthetical cognitions, but only analytical ones, can be obtained."
     "I must, therefore, in the present case, deduce the subjective sequence of apprehension from the objective sequence of phenomena, for otherwise the former is quite undetermined, and one phenomenon is not distinguishable from another."
     "I term all subjective principles, which are not derived from observation of the constitution of an object, but from the interest which Reason has in producing a certain completeness in her cognition of that object, maxims of reason."
     "It follows that in objects of perception, that is, in phenomena, there must be found a substratum which represents time in general, and in which all change or coexistence can be perceived by means of the relation of phenomena to it."
     "It must, therefore, be considered as the condition of the possibility of phenomena, and by no means as a determination dependent on them, and is a representation à priori, which necessarily supplies the basis for external phenomena."
     "Leibnitz did not announce this proposition with precisely the pomp of a new principle, he yet employed it for the establishment of new propositions, and his followers introduced it into their Leibnitzio-Wolfian system of philosophy."
     "On the contrary, every one is conscious that, when any one is held up to him as a model of virtue, he compares this so-called model with the true original which he possesses in his own mind and values him according to this standard."
     "On this account, although the subject of the following chapters is the especial principles of understanding, I shall make use of the term Doctrine of the faculty of judgement, in order to define more particularly my present purpose."
     "Pure general logic has to do, therefore, merely with pure à priori principles, and is a canon of understanding and reason, but only in respect of the formal part of their use, be the content what it may, empirical or transcendental."
     "So long as the object of our rational conceptions is the totality of conditions in the world of phenomena, and the satisfaction, from this source, of the requirements of reason, so long are our ideas transcendental and cosmological."
     "The thinker requires, to be fully equipped, the hypotheses of pure reason, which, although but leaden weapons (for they have not been steeled in the armoury of experience), are as useful as any that can be employed by his opponents."
     "As, therefore, in the character of pure categories, they must be employed empirically, and cannot be employed transcendentally, they are of no use at all, when separated from sensibility, that is, they cannot be applied to an object."
     "But I cannot hence infer that, given merely the moving power of a body, the body may be cogitated as simple substance, merely because the representation in my mind takes no account of its content in space, and is consequently simple."
     "But man, to whom nature reveals herself only through sense, cognizes himself not only by his senses, but also through pure apperception; and this in actions and internal determinations, which he cannot regard as sensuous impressions."
     "For the condition of the objective use of all our conceptions of understanding is the mode of our sensuous intuition, whereby objects are given; and, if we make abstraction of the latter, the former can have no relation to an object."
     "From all this it results that action alone, as an empirical criterion, is a sufficient proof of the presence of substantiality, without any necessity on my part of endeavouring to discover the permanence of substance by a comparison."
     "Analytical judgements do not teach us any more about an object than what was contained in the conception we had of it; because they do not extend our cognition beyond our conception of an object, they merely elucidate the conception."
     "But apart from this relation, à priori synthetical propositions are absolutely impossible, because they have no third term, that is, no pure object, in which the synthetical unity can exhibit the objective reality of its conceptions."
     "Now a pure category, in which all conditions of sensuous intuition — as the only intuition we possess — are abstracted, does not determine an object, but merely expresses the thought of an object in general, according to different modes."
     "The conception of twelve is by no means obtained by merely cogitating the union of seven and five; and we may analyse our conception of such a possible sum as long as we will, still we shall never discover in it the notion of twelve."
     "The faculty of sensuous intuition is properly a receptivity — a capacity of being affected in a certain manner by representations, the relation of which to each other is a pure intuition of space and time — the pure forms of sensibility."
     "The same function which gives unity to the different representation in a judgement, gives also unity to the mere synthesis of different representations in an intuition; and this unity we call the pure conception of the understanding."
     "The unconditioned, if it does really exist, must be especially considered in regard to the determinations which distinguish it from whatever is conditioned, and will thus afford us material for many à priori synthetical propositions."
     "We must understand, on the contrary, by the term freedom, in the cosmological sense, a faculty of the spontaneous origination of a state; the causality of which, therefore, is not subordinated to another cause determining it in time."
     "And thus we are induced to hold the empirical principle of our conceptions of the possibility of things, as phenomena, by leaving out this limitative condition, to be a transcendental principle of the possibility of things in general."
     "But as I require for this purpose something that is permanent, such as is not given in internal intuition; the mode of my existence, whether as substance or as accident, cannot be determined by means of this simple self-consciousness."
     "But we cannot cogitate it as a thing determinable by certain distinct predicates relating to its internal nature, for it has no connection with empirical conceptions; nor are we justified in affirming the existence of any such object."
     "Eternal phenomena must be capable of influencing it; and its actions, in accordance with natural laws, must explain to us how its empirical character, that is, the law of its causality, is to be cognized in and by means of experience."
     "For all synthetical principles of the understanding are valid only as immanent in experience; while the cognition of a Supreme Being necessitates their being employed transcendentally, and of this the understanding is quite incapable."
     "If, therefore, we wish to apply the categories to objects which cannot be regarded as phenomena, we must have an intuition different from the sensuous, and in this case the objects would be a noumena in the positive sense of the word."
     "For my own part, I must henceforward abstain from controversy, although I shall carefully attend to all suggestions, whether from friends or adversaries, which may be of use in the future elaboration of the system of this Propædeutic."
     "In addition to accordance with the formal conditions of experience, the understanding requires a connection with some perception; but that which is connected with this perception is real, even although it is not immediately perceived."
     "In respect to things in general, unlimited reality was regarded as the matter of all possibility, the limitation thereof (negation) as the form, by which one thing is distinguished from another according to transcendental conceptions."
     "The manifold nature of things is only an infinitely various mode of limiting the conception of the highest reality, which is their common substratum; just as all figures are possible only as different modes of limiting infinite space."
     "The objections raised against the fallacies and sophistries of speculative reason, are objections given by the nature of this reason itself, and must therefore have a destination and purpose which can only be for the good of humanity."
     "Thus the common definition of a circle — that it is a curved line, every point in which is equally distant from another point called the centre — is faulty, from the fact that the determination indicated by the word curved is superfluous."
     "Thus the supposition of a Supreme Being or cause is purely relative; it is cogitated only in behalf of the systematic unity of experience; such a being is but a something, of whose existence in itself we have not the least conception."
     "Whether I have succeeded in what I professed to do, it is for the reader to determine; it is the author’s business merely to adduce grounds and reasons, without determining what influence these ought to have on the mind of his judges."
     "An idea is employed transcendently, when it is applied to an object falsely believed to be adequate with and to correspond to it; imminently, when it is applied solely to the employment of the understanding in the sphere of experience."
     "And yet we require these conceptions (which have their origin in the reason, so far as regards their absolute purity and completeness) for the purpose of determining the share which each of these natural causes has in every phenomenon."
     "For the subjective grounds of a judgement, such as produce belief, cannot be admitted in speculative inquiries, inasmuch as they cannot stand without empirical support and are incapable of being communicated to others in equal measure."
     "For, supposing you were to term all positing of a thing reality, you have thereby posited the thing with all its predicates in the conception of the subject and assumed its actual existence, and this you merely repeat in the predicate."
     "Accordingly, there are three rules of all relations of time in phenomena, according to which the existence of every phenomenon is determined in respect of the unity of all time, and these antecede all experience and render it possible."
     "At the same time, this indifference, which has arisen in the world of science, and which relates to that kind of knowledge which we should wish to see destroyed the last, is a phenomenon that well deserves our attention and reflection."
     "But I can /think/ what I please, provided only I do not contradict myself; that is, provided my conception is a possible thought, though I may be unable to answer for the existence of a corresponding object in the sum of possibilities."
     "But in this case, no à priori synthetical cognition of them could be possible, consequently not through pure conceptions of space and the science which determines these conceptions, that is to say, geometry, would itself be impossible."
     "In all subsumptions of an object under a conception, the representation of the object must be homogeneous with the conception; in other words, the conception must contain that which is represented in the object to be subsumed under it."
     "In the science of nature, where all assertion is based upon empirical intuition, such subreptions may be guarded against by the repeated comparison of observations; but this mode of proof is of little value in this sphere of knowledge."
     "Laws do not exist except by relation to the subject in which the phenomena inhere, in so far as it possesses understanding, just as phenomena have no existence except by relation to the same existing subject in so far as it has senses."
     "My intention here is by no means to combat the notion of empty space; for it may exist where our perceptions cannot exist, inasmuch as they cannot reach thereto, and where, therefore, no empirical perception of coexistence takes place."
     "Now all intuition possible to us is sensuous; consequently, our thought of an object by means of a pure conception of the understanding, can become cognition for us only in so far as this conception is applied to objects of the senses."
     "So far, then, as practical reason has the right to conduct us, we shall not look upon actions as binding on us, because they are the commands of God, but we shall regard them as divine commands, because we are internally bound by them."
     "That the same unity exists in nature is presupposed by philosophers in the well-known scholastic maxim, which forbids us unnecessarily to augment the number of entities or principles (entia praeter necessitatem non esse multiplicanda)."
     "The one relates to the objects of the pure understanding, and is intended to demonstrate and to render comprehensible the objective validity of its /à priori/ conceptions; and it forms for this reason an essential part of the Critique."
     "The question hence arises: How happens it that reason regards the possibility of all things as deduced from a single possibility, that, to wit, of the highest reality, and presupposes this as existing in an individual and primal being?"
     "The rule of right and wrong must help us to the knowledge of what is right or wrong in all possible cases; otherwise, the idea of obligation or duty would be utterly null, for we cannot have any obligation to that which we cannot know."
     "This faculty, accordingly, enounces laws, which are imperative or objective laws of freedom and which tell us what ought to take place, thus distinguishing themselves from the laws of nature, which relate to that which does take place."
     "We cannot understand, in fact, how a logical principle of unity can of right exist, unless we presuppose a transcendental principle, by which such a systematic unit — as a property of objects themselves — is regarded as necessary à priori."
     "But they are incompetent to present any of the conceptions which appear in them in an à priori intuition; these can be given only à posteriori, in experience, which, however, is itself possible only through these synthetical principles."
     "But as this exercise of reason is not always directed on the determination of the object, in other words, on cognition thereof, but also on the determination of the subject and its volition, I do not intend to treat of it in this place."
     "Consequently, the representation of space cannot be borrowed from the relations of external phenomena through experience; but, on the contrary, this external experience is itself only possible through the said antecedent representation."
     "For the form of reason has its law, which, without taking into consideration the particular nature of the cognition about which it is employed, can be discovered à priori, by the simple analysis of the action of reason into its momenta."
     "For this purpose, it is requisite, firstly, that such cognitions do really flow from the given conception; and, secondly, that the said cognitions are only possible under the presupposition of a given mode of explaining this conception."
     "It has, in fact, hitherto escaped this humiliation, only because, in presence of its magnificent pretensions and high position, no one could readily suspect it to be capable of substituting fancies for conceptions, and words for things."
     "It matters not whether the sensuous impulses favoured or opposed the action of this causality, the offence is estimated according to its intelligible character — the offender is decidedly worthy of blame, the moment he utters a falsehood."
     "Nay, even our own existence, which would in this case depend upon the self-existent reality of such a mere nonentity as time, would necessarily be changed with it into mere appearance — an absurdity which no one has as yet been guilty of."
     "Now in order that this relation may be cognized as determined, the relation between the two states must be so cogitated that it is thereby determined as necessary, which of them must be placed before and which after, and not conversely."
     "Reason, in its logical use, endeavours to discover the general condition of its judgement (the conclusion), and a syllogism is itself nothing but a judgement by means of the subsumption of its condition under a general rule (the major)."
     "The absolute whole of quantity (the universe), of division, of derivation, of the condition of existence, with the question — whether it is to be produced by finite or infinite synthesis, no possible experience can instruct us concerning."
     "The second asserts that reason is capable of presenting us, from the analogy with nature, with a more definite conception of this being, and that its operations, as the cause of all things, are the results of intelligence and free will."
     "To establish the truth of the latter opinion, it would be necessary to prove that all things would be in themselves incapable of this harmony and order, unless they were, even as regards their substance, the product of a supreme wisdom."
     "And yet all we aim at is the possession of this idea as a secure foundation for the systematic unity of experience — a unity indispensable to reason, advantageous to the understanding, and promotive of the interests of empirical cognition."
     "For if the smallest empirical element of thought, if any particular perception of my internal state, were to be introduced among the grounds of cognition of this science, it would not be a rational, but an empirical doctrine of the soul."
     "For this necessary being, as an intelligible condition, would not form a member — not even the highest member — of the series; the whole world of sense would be left in its empirically determined existence uninterfered with and uninfluenced."
     "e of something absolutely necessary; and, still advancing, proceed from the conception of the absolute necessity of the first cause to the completely determined or determining conception thereof — the conception of an all-embracing reality."
     "If dogmatical assertions are advanced on the negative side, in opposition to those made by reason on the positive side, its justification kat authrhopon is complete, although the proof of its propositions is kat aletheian unsatisfactory."
     "All cognition, by means of which I am enabled to cognize and determine à priori what belongs to empirical cognition, may be called an anticipation; and without doubt this is the sense in which Epicurus employed his expression prholepsis."
     "But by this proceeding we accomplish only this much, that the infinite sphere of all possible existences is in so far limited that the mortal is excluded from it, and the soul is placed in the remaining part of the extent of this sphere."
     "But it has been far from my intention, in these remarks, to prove the existence of this unconditioned and necessary being, or even to evidence the possibility of a purely intelligible condition of the existence or all sensuous phenomena."
     "But this part remains, notwithstanding this exception, infinite, and more and more parts may be taken away from the whole sphere, without in the slightest degree thereby augmenting or affirmatively determining our conception of the soul."
     "But, however widely extended, however accurate and thoroughgoing this consciousness may be, these representations are still nothing more than representations, that is, internal determinations of the mind in this or that relation of time."
     "For that which of necessity impels us to transcend the limits of experience and of all phenomena is the /unconditioned/, which reason absolutely requires in things as they are in themselves, in order to complete the series of conditions."
     "It follows that I am not entitled to make any assertion at all respecting the whole object of experience — the world of sense; I must limit my declarations to the rule according to which experience or empirical knowledge is to be attained."
     "Now there is nothing to hinder us from admitting these ideas to possess an objective and hyperbolic existence, except the cosmological ideas, which lead reason into an antinomy: the psychological and theological ideas are not antinomial."
     "Now, if to this real in the substance we ascribe a particular existence (for example, to motion as an accident of matter), this existence is called inherence, in contradistinction to the existence of substance, which we call subsistence."
     "Of these it is impossible to present an intelligible conception; they are a kind of monogram, drawn according to no determinate rule, and forming rather a vague picture — the production of many diverse experiences — than a determinate image."
     "The notion of substance, for example, if we leave out the sensuous determination of permanence, would mean nothing more than a something which can be cogitated as subject, without the possibility of becoming a predicate to anything else."
     "We should require to introduce into our proof conceptions of contingent beings — regarded merely as objects of the understanding, and also a principle which enables us to connect these, by means of mere conceptions, with a necessary being."
     "Analytical definitions, on the other hand, may be erroneous in many respects, either by the introduction of signs which do not actually exist in the conception, or by wanting in that completeness which forms the essential of a definition."
     "For every cause supposes a rule, according to which certain phenomena follow as effects from the cause, and every rule requires uniformity in these effects; and this is the proper ground of the conception of a cause — as a faculty or power."
     "Hence pure reason hopes to be able to extend its empire in the transcendental sphere with equal success and security, especially when it applies the same method which was attended with such brilliant results in the science of mathematics."
     "Hence the first step which we take out of the world of sense obliges us to begin our system of new cognition with the investigation of a necessary being, and to deduce from our conceptions of it all our conceptions of intelligible things."
     "Consequently, the merely logical criterion of truth, namely, the accordance of a cognition with the universal and formal laws of understanding and reason, is nothing more than the conditio sine qua non, or negative condition of all truth."
     "For whence could our experience itself acquire certainty, if all the rules on which it depends were themselves empirical, and consequently fortuitous? No one, therefore, can admit the validity of the use of such rules as first principles."
     "Such quantities may also be called flowing, because synthesis (of the productive imagination) in the production of these quantities is a progression in time, the continuity of which we are accustomed to indicate by the expression flowing."
     "That which determines the internal sense is the understanding, and its original power of conjoining the manifold of intuition, that is, of bringing this under an apperception (upon which rests the possibility of the understanding itself)."
     "The determinability of every conception is subordinate to the universality (Allgemeinheit, universalitas) of the principle of excluded middle; the determination of a thing to the totality (Allheit, universitas) of all possible predicates."
     "The mundus intelligibilis is nothing but the general conception of a world, in which abstraction has been made of all conditions of intuition, and in relation to which no synthetical proposition — either affirmative or negative — is possible."
     "There cannot, therefore, exist any canon for the speculative exercise of this faculty — for its speculative exercise is entirely dialectical; and, consequently, transcendental logic, in this respect, is merely a discipline, and not a canon."
     "To what extent a body may be organized, experience alone can inform us; and although, so far as our experience of this or that body has extended, we may not have discovered any inorganic part, such parts must exist in possible experience."
     "What this basis of cosmical unity may be in itself, we know not — we cannot discover from the idea; we merely know how we ought to employ the idea of this unity, in relation to the systematic operation of reason in the sphere of experience."
     "According to this meaning, some have chosen to call the complex of phenomena, in so far as it is intuited, mundus sensibilis, but in so far as the connection thereof is cogitated according to general laws of thought, mundus intelligibilis."
     "All the conceptions produced, and all the questions raised, by pure reason, do not lie in the sphere of experience, but in that of reason itself, and hence they must be solved, and shown to be either valid or inadmissible, by that faculty."
     "And thus all our powers of sense, as well as all phenomenal reality, phenomenal reality, may be with propriety regarded as belonging to this series of effects, while they could not have formed parts of the idea, considered as an aggregate."
     "But the unlimited all is an absolute unity, and is conceived by the mind as a being one and supreme; and thus reason concludes that the Supreme Being, as the primal basis of all things, possesses an existence which is absolutely necessary."
     "But we should express our meaning better, and with less risk of being misunderstood, if we said that we can have no knowledge of an object, which perfectly corresponds to an idea, although we may possess a problematical conception thereof."
     "For such an axiom could not exert a stronger influence on the extension and rectification of our knowledge, otherwise than by procuring for the principles of the understanding the most widely expanded employment in the field of experience."
     "Besides, they often weaken the power of our understanding to apprehend rules or laws in their universality, independently of particular circumstances of experience; and hence, accustom us to employ them more as formulae than as principles."
     "But if we regard it more narrowly, we find that our conception of the sum of seven and five contains nothing more than the uniting of both sums into one, whereby it cannot at all be cogitated what this single number is which embraces both."
     "But the real — that which corresponds to sensation — in opposition to negation = 0, only represents something the conception of which in itself contains a being (ein seyn), and signifies nothing but the synthesis in an empirical consciousness."
     "But this principle prescribes no law to objects, and does not contain any ground of the possibility of cognizing or of determining them as such, but is merely a subjective law for the proper arrangement of the content of the understanding."
     "In this enlarged signification, then, shall I employ the word absolute, in opposition to that which is valid only in some particular respect; for the latter is restricted by conditions, the former is valid without any restriction whatever."
     "It is, therefore, only in the category of causality that we can find a series of causes to a given effect, and in which we ascend from the latter, as the conditioned, to the former as the conditions, and thus answer the question of reason."
     "It was considered a great step when chemists were able to reduce all salts to two main genera — acids and alkalis; and they regard this difference as itself a mere variety, or different manifestation of one and the same fundamental material."
     "No action would begin or cease to be in this subject; it would consequently be free from the law of all determination of time — the law of change, namely, that everything which happens must have a cause in the phenomena of a preceding state."
     "There exists, therefore, a sublime and wise cause (or several), which is not merely a blind, all-powerful nature, producing the beings and events which fill the world in unconscious fecundity, but a free and intelligent cause of the world."
     "This idea is a legislative one; and hence it is very natural that we should assume the existence of a legislative reason corresponding to it, from which the systematic unity of nature — the object of the operations of reason — must be derived."
     "This latter statement — an ambitious one — requires to be supported by data which are not to be discovered in thought; and are perhaps (in so far as I consider the thinking self merely as such) not to be discovered in the thinking self at all."
     "Thus an application of the category to phenomena becomes possible, by means of the transcendental determination of time, which, as the schema of the conceptions of the understanding, mediates the subsumption of the latter under the former."
     "Thus, while it may be no very difficult task to bequeath a legacy to posterity, in the shape of a system of metaphysics constructed in accordance with the Critique of Pure Reason, still the value of such a bequest is not to be depreciated."
     "An ideal is not even given as a cogitable object, and therefore cannot be inscrutable; on the contrary, it must, as a mere idea, be based on the constitution of reason itself, and on this account must be capable of explanation and solution."
     "From the changes in the world they have concluded their empirical contingency, that is, their dependence on empirically-determined causes, and they thus admitted an ascending series of empirical conditions: and in this they are quite right."
     "As the pure intuition in all phenomena is either time or space, so is every phenomenon in its character of intuition an extensive quantity, inasmuch as it can only be cognized in our apprehension by successive synthesis (from part to part)."
     "But from this deduction of the faculty of /à priori/ cognition in the first part of metaphysics, we derive a surprising result, and one which, to all appearance, militates against the great end of metaphysics, as treated in the second part."
     "But, inasmuch as one part of space is not given, but only limited, by and through another, we must also consider every limited space as conditioned, in so far as it presupposes some other space as the condition of its limitation, and so on."
     "Criticism, on the contrary, deciding all questions according to the fundamental laws of its own institution, secures to us the peace of law and order, and enables us to discuss all differences in the more tranquil manner of a legal process."
     "For, as a doctrine, that is, as an endeavour to enlarge the sphere of the understanding in regard to pure à priori cognitions, philosophy is worse than useless, since from all the attempts hitherto made, little or no ground has been gained.")))
